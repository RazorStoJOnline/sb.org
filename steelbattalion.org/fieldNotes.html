<P>
<span class=header>CAMPAIGN 1</span>
<P>
<span class=header>*HAI SHI DAO 2080*</span>
<br><span class=body>If you have a new pilot this campaign will begin with the "Tutorial" which doesn't teach you squat, it's just an easy mission and not a tutorial at all. After you have completed mission 10 and select this scenario again you will begin at mission 1. As long as you don't get too cocky on mission 9 and take mission 10 step by step you should have no problem repeating this scenario set over and over to gain supply points and gain rank. I would suggest playing through at least twice (more if you want to pilot the 3rd generation from the beginning) before moving on to the second scenario, as it starts off easy but gets hard fast.Also, you get the rail gun for mission 8, and after you beat mission 10 you can repeat the first scenario enabling a VT on mission 1 with a rail gun and missiles. This changes things drastically, as you no longer have to tip-toe around the battlefield, rather you see an enemy VT, and then it becomes very dead, very quickly. As such for missions 1-7 there is a section describing how you should change your strategy to adapt with the new firepower at your disposal.</span>
<P>
<span class=date>Format for mission walkthroughs is as displayed below:
<br>Mission # - (mission contents.)(Clear requirements.) 
<br>*(How you do it.)
<br>**(How you do it with bigger guns, for missions 1-7)
<br>***(Any other secrets or stuff you should know.)</span>
<P>
<span class=header>Let's begin:</span>
<P>
<span class=header>Tutorial</span><span class=date> - Destroy attacking forces. Destroy enemy VTs.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Power up your VT and take out the VT that is breaking down the door, exit and take out the remaining VT to your left to clear the level. Spray the troops at your feet with MG fire if it makes you happy, the giraffes are the only other thing in the level that can hurt you but they are not necessary to clear the level.</span><P>
<a name=1><span class=header>Mission 1</span><span class=date> - Storm the beach and destroy enemy forces. Destroy 70% of enemy forces.</span><br>
<span class=body>*The only things that can hurt you here are the giraffes and VTs in between the towers and the enemy VT/giraffe clusters to the upper far right and left corners after you pass the main wall.<br>
<span class=body>**Same drill, the enemy just has less time to be afraid before they become dead.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=2><span class=header>Mission 2</span><span class=date> - Your convoy is ambushed by a new VT with Artillery capabilities. Destroy all new type VTs.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Power up, and exit the box you're in. Zoom your map out and see as you proceed forward and to the right there is a ramp to climb up to the top of the mesa. Climb up and take out the Vortex VTs to clear the mission. You can take them out from below with cannon fire but it takes forever.<br>
<span class=body>**Exit the box, and make a U-turn to the left, target and destroy the VT out there with a rail gun hit, next make your way to the other side of the transports and target the Vortexes at the top of the mesas. Use missiles to take them out. (Notice how the missiles will fly up to match altitude with target, then continue moving forward, this knowledge comes in very handy in later missions.)<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=3><span class=header>Mission 3</span><span class=date> - Charge the City. Make it to the check point to clear the mission.</span><br>
<span class=body>*The path straight ahead that you are supposed to take involves you crossing a bridge which is easily shot out by enemy (and friendly) fire. When it goes, so do you into the water and to your death. No thank you. Instead move to the right and you should be able to see on your radar where there is a huge crossing for the river. There are enemy artillery units bombarding the area so if you are moving slow you will get hit. Back up as far as you need to and get a running start you should be in top gear and at full speed when you hit the water. If you do it right you should be across the river before you know it. When you reach the other side you can take out the enemy VTs if you want but it is unnecessary. B-line to the city and head straight. As you enter the City there is a group of two Vitzh and a Scarface. Take them out or ignore them as you please but make it to the edge of the map before your mission time runs out. Only one spot will trigger a clear mission, look for the tower as a landmark (you should see it from where the Scarface was) and head towards it.<br>
<span class=body>**You've got big guns now. Stay off the bridge unless you're feeling lucky and take the VTs out at your leisure as you make your way to the check point. Overdrive will help you wade through the water quickly. One final word of caution: if you have the Autobot code enabled DO NOT cross the water in the crouched mode, you will cause a water death. <P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=4><span class=header>Mission 4</span><span class=date> - You sunk my Battleship! Sink the Battleship in dock.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Move forward from your starting position, and take the bridges when crossing platforms. Towards the end there will be panels between the platforms that a light VT can cross, but they can be shot out and it's not worth the risk or the sacrifice in firepower you make for the light VT. Machine gun down the 3 missile boats patrolling this side or keep the chaff handy. As you reach the last platform take out the surrounding VTs while being careful to stay out of the Battleship's main gun range. After your path is clear make a dash to the square hanger building to the left of the battleship. This building can take unlimited damage so use it to hide behind as you concentrate your fire on the ship's two main guns. After they are destroyed you can destroy the smaller guns on the side or just concentrate fire on the ship's hull. Then sit back and enjoy the spectacle of the Battleship going down.<br>
<span class=body>**Same drill, except the battleship will be going down a lot faster with the rail gun. Remember that the ship has nothing lockable so use your missiles on the VTs before you get there. Also take the extra second to line up your first two rail gun shots to take out the two main guns facing you, once they are gone you are 100% safe as the small turrets on the side don't have the effective range to reach you and do any damage.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=5><span class=header>Mission 5</span><span class=date> - Parts recovery. Pick up the three crates.</span><br>
<span class=body>*There are a few weak enemies scattered about, and a bunch of little soldiers that will try to scratch your paintjob. Take out the enemy VTs then use the rest of the time to search for the three crates. They will be on the back of a truck and as you get close you should see an orange hexagon where you have to grab it with the manipulator arm. Once you have it in the arm press the manipulator arm button again to put it away, get the other two and you're done. The crates are scatter around but a general guide is get the first one close to the first VT you spot, the other two are located at the far ends of the map one straight ahead and the other to the left of the second crate. Play with the cows or give the village a sprinkling of machine gun fire if you get bored (those huts must be filled with explosives because just one MG round will turn them into a raging inferno). <br>
<span class=body>**Same drill, swifter death.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=6><span class=header>Mission 6</span><span class=date> - Enemy base search. Find the base then run like a girl when the enemy VTs start pouring out of the door.</span><br>
<span class=body>*(it's a good idea to bring extra gas for this one as it involves lots of running and dodging.) Progress forward taking out enemies as they show themselves. You will hit a wall so veer right and take the narrow canyon passage. After a while you will come to a three way intersection, continue forward and destroy the VT there to make your escape easier, this will be your escape route, U-turn and continue down the third way, at the opening there will be 3 VTs waiting for you. (Some people have mailed me about having trouble with getting pass the VTs in the narrow canyon pass, if you are having trouble fighting normally you can equip a howitzer and take them out that way as well. The artillery shells will arc over the canyon walls and hit even without LOS) Next turn right, and head into the open area, destroy the lone VT without getting too close to the base door. Call for supplies if you need the gas. Next position yourself so you can run close to the door and trigger the event, the door will open and Argus will ask you to run away. Overdrive time. Run like a scared child, weave to avoid canon fire, chaff the missiles. If you're feeling lucky you can back out  of the canyon while fighting off the attacking VTs, but you had better be good if you want to make it out alive. Head back out the canyon passage and take the escape route, after running for a while you will clear the mission.<br>
<span class=body>**Just on an off note, this is one of the rare opportunities that you have to use the AVTM (mine weapon) on. As you back away from the door drop a few mines, when the enemy VTs come charging after you they will be tripped up by the mines.<br>
<span class=body>**Same drill, just seems a lot easier for some reason. You will be good enough and will have the firepower to fight the VTs that come out of the base but they will continually re-spawn so if you do decide to do some damage before leaving, do so away from the base so there will be a gap from when they spawn at the base entrance and from when they catch up and start shooting at you. Destroy all you want, they will make more.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=7><span class=header>Mission 7</span><span class=date> - Night attack. Enter the base and enter and then destroy the VT in the last room.</span><br>
<span class=body>*You can use your night vision here but it may hinder more than help in the open, best to save it for inside the base's dark hallways. Also 2nd generation night vision is green, so is your HUD, time to use the line color change button to re-coordinate to something a little easier to see. Or just leave it off altogether, I know you want to use it but you really don't need it to navigate, and the enemies are all very easy to spot with the big green box around them against the night background. Proceed to the base entrance taking out enemy VTs as you progress, this time the placement is different and there are less VTs. Once you reach the entrance and secure the area call for a supply chopper (you should have at least one extra tank for this mission, you can do it with one but leave the override off when you don't need it) and gas up. Use the manipulator arm to operate the door switches and enter, ignore the fleeing jeeps and proceed to the right, see that smoldering VT? That should be a clue, open the door and standing on the other side at point blank will be an enemy VT, knock him down with a few cannon shots (or a plasma torch if you have it) while protecting your body behind the doorway. Run down the hall and be ready to target the missile spider that comes around the corner to the left. Target with FSS and fire before he rounds the corner and you should destroy it before any missiles come your way. Proceed to the left and enter the elevator, operate switch with arm from the inside. When you get out you'll see what friendly VTs do when they're not walking in circles, that's right blowing up. Get in about override 3rd and strafe the giraffes on the other side, it's best to take them out now rather than later. Open the door at the end, ignore the two rooms ahead of you (enemy VT in each) and proceed to the right also ignore the foot soldiers. Open the door and run to the end, enter the elevator and proceed. When you exit again ignore the troops at your feet and run forward, two spiders will com out of the hallways, first from the right then the left as you run forward, use chaff if they have time to get a shot off. At the end of the hallway there will be a door. Open it and enter to find another door, open it as well and prepare for the last fight. Inside the next room will be a VT, its tough (took two rail gun hits and kept going) and dodges a lot (read: VT on major crack), so don't expect a fast kill. Fight defensively and use the doorway to protect your body while you wear him down. Do not let him corner you if he gets too close keep track of which way you are open to dodge, the plasma torch attack is easy to see coming so dodge it and then make him pay. Destroy the VT to clear the mission.<br>
<span class=body>**If you've got the extra gas and ammo check out the small room to your left as you enter the second floor of the base, in the back of the room you will find a VT-sized box with a switch. Inside is a Quasar VT. You'll receive a COM from Argus then the Quasar will be useable from the next mission. (Similar VT boxes are located in the other room as well as the 2 rooms on level 3 but they are all empty.) (Note that the Quasar is in that room on your FIRST ATTEMPT, if you do not complete the mission the first time and try again, then the quasar is probably in another room, either on the same level or the one below.)<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=8><span class=header>Mission 8</span><span class=date> - The hunt. Destroy all enemy VTs.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Here we get the Rail Gun and go out to hunt a few fleeing enemy VTs. Hunt them down before they escape, just a few Vitzh and Scarfaces, you've got a rail gun slug for each VT, easy prey for your new toy.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=9><span class=header>Mission 9</span><span class=date> - VT battle. Destroy 70% of enemy forces.</span><br>
<span class=body>*The buck stops here, join the biggest VT battle you've ever been a part of (despite the presence of friendly VTs, be prepared to do all the work yourself). The Enemy VT's in the front are all weak (Vortex and Scarface/Vitzh groupings), clean them up at your leisure with rail gun and missiles then move on to the bigger ones in the rear(be careful the groups are a little bigger here). When attacking the two groupings in the rear be careful of a stray Behemoth that may be lurking to the side, don't rely on your radar and keep your camera moving searching for possible targets. If you get damaged back off and call for another supply run, 2000 points in extra supplies is cheaper than buying a new VT and doing it again.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=10><span class=header>Mission 10</span><span class=date> - Assault on the capital. Destroy presidential building then the Juggernaut VT that spawns in front of it.</span><br>
<span class=body>* You've got time and supplies so take it slow. You can B-line it to the presidential building and secure it, destroy the building, then the boss than spawns with that event and ignore the rest of the map, OR you can take advantage of all those easy kills lying around and make some major command points. If you're up to a little fun first make your way towards the Stadium, ahead and to the left of your starting position. There are giraffes here and there, if you have to make a turn or move close take them out with a cannon or MG if in range, in not move by at high speed and ignore them. Once you reach the Stadium on the hill you will notice that the Stadium walls prevent you from targeting the enemy VTs inside, move around (taking out resistance as you do so) to the road leading in and the break in the stadium wall. Target the VTs in the open and take them out with rail gun and missiles. You may have to run in and get the last few VTs with a cannon or rain gun shot if they don't move in the open. After you're done here make a U-turn and head parallel to the presidential building land island/hill (the only other hill on the map besides the stadium). You will enter a large open area and there will be VT and giraffe aplenty in the distance use any ammo you have left then back off and call for supplies. Finish them off then time to attack the presidential island.<br>
The front is guarded by 6 regals; 3 on each side. As you make your way to the back take out the 3 that are on your side (they won't show up on radar so watch the hill as you run). The best way is to bombard them with missiles from your low altitude position (this stops working once you get to the higher difficulty levels as the missiles will crash into the hill as they are moving so fast they don't have time to gain enough altitude). Once you reach the rear of the island take out any resistance and then make your way up the road to the hill. Once up there advance on the remaining 3 regals and take them out. Give the building a few shots if you have them left over (be careful the building crumbles around 3000 damage), then re-supply if you are damaged or low on ammo and then finish the building off with the cannon. This will  trigger a juggernaut VT to spawn in front of the presidential building so position yourself to get a good shot at him (standing anywhere against the front of the building will put you at his back), he has a rail gun and can take a few rail gun hits, so don't let your guard down.<br>
Once you destroy the Juggernaut you will get an ending with a series of mediocre Photoshop's of VT's and stock war photos. Then it's back to business as usual, when you select your character you will be given the chance to start the first scenario set over again, or begin the second one. However once you start a scenario you will have to continue playing until either you beat the last level (10 or 23) or run out of supply points so think it over and make your choice.<br>
<span class=body>**You don't have to Take out any other VTs than the final Juggernaut (and the presidential building to trigger his arrival). If you have the fire power and the confidence feel free to rush the presidential island, destroy the building, then the Juggernaut. You will clear the mission, just be careful if you left the regals around because the Juggernaut takes a while to explode, make sure you don't die waiting for him to. Also while that way saves a lot of time you are missing out on a lot of easy kills. So if you're trying to build up command points, don't waste the chance.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=campaign2><span class=header>CAMPAIGN 2</span><P>
<span class=header>HAI SHI DAO 2080</span><br>
<span class=body>All right now you have command over your X-ray squad, and you're ready for some new missions and maps! Too bad, these are the same old missions with the same old maps (with the exception of 3 new maps), a few new enemies, but overall just a few small tweaks to the mission objectives. You will now have COM capabilities, assign commands for buttons 4 & 5 in the VT setup menu so you can give X-ray troop commands that they never listen to and instead walk in circles taking hits and missing a lot (unless you tell them to go home, in which case the respond to the order with extreme professionalism). One final thing, beating mission 23 is hard, you will need tons of supply points until you figure out what's going on. Reading this will make the missions A LOT easier (half the problem is knowing what is what you have to do and what is going to happen next) but you will die all the same. For smooth sailing, (and to avoid a repeat from zero) make sure you have enough supply points to buy supply chopper runs, and replacement VTs by playing the first scenario a few more times. You will also be able to unlock and operate 3rd generation VTs.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=11><span class=header>Mission 11</span><span class=date> - Beach Assault (didn't we do this already?). Destroy 70%.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Same drill, just you get to destroy a few extra m-vitzh along with the normal enemies.Destroying the Giraffes and VTs will not be enough, so stomp on a few trucks to get to 70%.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=12><span class=header>Mission 12</span><span class=date> - Chopper madness. Protect your transports from the swarm of choppers assaulting them.</span><br>
<span class=body>*(bring lots of machine gun for this mission!) Get out and start downing the choppers and occasional VT (you'll only encounter light class VTs). You have two teammates but their advanced AI will be so confused that they will just sit around drawing fire. Concentrate on the bigger choppers that fire homing missiles and the occasional VT. After you clean up the area (there are enemy VTs in front and behind the transport convoy) and down a bunch of choppers, the mission will end. I think the clear flag is a point limit as I down different numbers of VTs and choppers every time.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=13><span class=header>Mission 13</span><span class=date> - ECM truck hunt. Destroy the three ECM trucks.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Same drill as last time except the second you power up you will be attacked from the right. Your radar is being blocked by three ECM trucks. Run across the river and clear the area of VTs while moving, (your radar is blind so if you hold still you will be vulnerable to artillery attacks that you cant see coming) next search for the ECM truck on the top of the hill, it's big, square, and has a satellite dish on the top. After you destroy one you will hear from Argus and should be able to see flashes on your radar, next move to the hill after the bridge near the edge of the map, number 2 destroyed. Now move to where the Scarface was in the city in mission 3, this time a Behemoth will be waiting for you, ECM number 3 is one intersection past where the enemy VTs are waiting for you. <P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=14><span class=header>Mission 14</span><span class=date> - Battleship & friends. Destroy the Battleship and the new destroyer patrolling the area.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Same strategy as mission 4 but be careful of a few things, one: take out the missile boats as soon as you can. They will waste your chaff that you will need for the destroyer. Two: Ignore the battleship and get to the safe spot behind the building, the destroyer will patrol back and forth firing missiles at you, but no unguided projectiles so relax, pop a chaff and sink it with a few rail gun/cannon hits as there's nothing to lock on to for missiles. Then it's easy, just repeat the same process of hiding behind the building and taking shots when you have the chance to sink the battleship.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=15><span class=header>Mission 15</span><span class=date> - VT Hunt. Destroy the fleeing VTs.</span><br>
<span class=body>*same as mission 8 with a slight enemy hardware upgrade. But you've not going to let a little Scarface II get in your way right? Do the job quick, but do it with precision. Running out of ammo and waiting for supplies is both a waste of time and supply points. On higher difficulty levels missiles just take too long. But they are still good for tripping up a fleeing VT at long range where you could never make an accurate cannon shot.<P>
<span class=header>FORK IN THE ROAD</span><br>
<span class=body>Now you will be asked if you want to join combat group A or B. "A group" will move you to missions 16 & 17 and be familiar maps with easy content. "B group" will move you to missions 18 & 19 and be new maps with harder content. Make the choice and move out.<P>
<a name=16><span class=header>Mission 16</span><span class=date> - Bomberman. Sneak in (read: blow everyone up before they can call for help.) without sounding the alarm, then place the bombs, detonate them and then run like a scared little girl.</span><br>
<span class=body>*First this mission has a timer that starts when you spot an enemy VT. If you don't destroy it before the time is up then the alarm sounds and its game over man. But that should be no problem for a rail gun. Keep a good lookout with your camera as there are stealth VTs out patrolling too. There is a Jarc. VT around the corner of the canyon pass with a hyped-up cannon that fires like crazy. If you approach from the left passageway you will be going toe to toe which is dangerous. Knock him down with a rail gun shot or approach from the right passage to get a clearer shot. When you reach the base door contact Black Widow on COM 4, he'll mark where you have to place bombs. To place a bomb extend your manipulator arm after you are contacted by Black Widow and low and behold, it's got a bomb in its hand! (why can't I do that normally? Wouldn't it be great to knock a VT down, put a bomb on it, then back away and detonate it from afar?) Placing the bombs is just like opening doors, do all three on the flashing light beacons on the door's frame then get far away. See how the F3 button was flashing but stopped as you got too far away, it's the detonation button so get within range so it flashes but not so close that you take damage from the explosion. Also when you detonate be facing away from the door because you have to run like in level 6. (or if you're feeling lucky back away in reverse and pick them off as they come to you until you run out of ammo.)<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=17><span class=header>Mission 17</span><span class=date> - Enemy base, again. Repeat mission 7 with different enemies.</span><br>
<span class=body>*You've destroyed the door so now you have to attack and secure the base before the enemy destroys any sensitive material. Read the walkthrough for mission 7, but expect a little more resistance. Two places to be careful of are: on the 3rd level of the base as you run down the hallway 4 Scylas instead of 2 will come out of the side hallways. Don't panic just keep using chaff as necessarily. Also when you open the final door the hyped-up Jaralaccs NS will be waiting for you with a Scyla on each side. Stay defensive as the Jar.-NS will take you out if you give him the chance.<br>
<span class=body>**If you've got the extra gas and ammo (and haven't already unlocked the Quasar VT) check out the small room to your left as you enter the second floor of the base, in the back of the room you will find a VT-sized box with a switch. Inside is a Quasar VT. You'll receive a COM from Argus then the Quasar will be useable from the next mission. (Similar VT boxes are located in the other room as well as the 2 rooms on level 3 but they are all empty. (Note that the Quasar is in that room on your FIRST ATTEMPT, if you do not complete the mission the first time and try again, then the quasar is probably in another room, either on the same level or the one below.)<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=18><span class=header>Mission 18</span><span class=date> - Hogan's Alley. Move forward killing trucks, then run away when the enemy shows itself.</span><br>
<span class=body>*This mission starts as an easy attack on a truck convoy. You can rack up some small-time points following the trucks or you can ignore the trucks and climb up the mesa as shown in the mission briefing. Either way once you get far enough you will encounter some Maelstroms positioned on the ridges. Argus will tell you to run away so run back and you will clear the mission once you reach the bottom of the mesa.<br>
<span class=body>**This is also the mission to unlock the Maelstrom VT.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=19><span class=header>Mission 19</span><span class=date> - Blade Drop. Destroy 70% of enemy forces.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Hey! The only cinema in this scenario set! You can only use light VTs so get out that blade or rapier (that no one ever uses) and go. This is also the only scenario that doesn't make you power up the VT at the beginning. Clean up the two enemy VTs ahead of you and for once spend some major time cleaning up the little targets on the ground as well. This is so you can reach your 70% goal more quickly. Climb up a ramp and start working your way around killing VT and non VT targets. After a while Argus will alert you that enemy reinforcements have arrived, you'll know them when you see them. The buildings in the that the reinforcements show up in really get in your way, and you have a fragile VT with weak weapons, take it slow. There are a lot of enemy VTs out there, resist the temptation to rush forward because you will be chewing off more than you can chew. Stay back and try to pick them off one at a time, good luck.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=20><span class=header>Mission 20</span><span class=date> - Deserters. Destroy the three Prominence M2 VTs.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Not only did they run away but they took the best VTs with them. Watch out for a new missile attack that you haven't seen before (I want that gun, sigh), but it's all the same when you press the chaff button.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=21><span class=header>Mission 21</span><span class=date> - VT battle. Destroy the three Juggernaut VTs.</span><br>
<span class=body>*Same setup as mission 9 but you can destroy VTs all day and more will come to replace them (vortexes will not re-spawn but Scarfaces and Vitzhs will). Keep your VT moving quickly and search and destroy the three Juggernaut VTs.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=22><span class=header>Mission 22</span><span class=date> - Hostage rescue. Rescue the 30 hostages from the presidential building.</span><br>
<span class=body>*This mission you must rescue some hostages from the presidential building. You know this map and it's the same drill as mission 10. When you have cleared out the perimeter of the building contact Argus, which will trigger a chopper pickup automatically. There is no confirmation, so don't call Argus unless its safe, or the chopper will be flying to its doom (but Argus will send as many as it takes, just wastes time if they are shot down on their pickup run). The chopper will hover over the building for a few moments then fly away. If they are destroyed while making the pickup or on their way out then you will still have cleared one of the three chopper runs. The difference between making a safe chopper run is only whether you get the points or not. You have to do this successfully three times then you will clear the mission. Be on the lookout though, as you call for the pickup, Regals will spawn from the rear or sides of the land-island (near the ramp closest to the map border). The number that spawn are different every time but normally three will spawn when you make the first call and another will show up later from the same direction (some times more sometimes less, sometimes with different timing. Keep a lookout in the direction that the chopper approaches from and prevent them from attacking the chopper.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
<a name=23><span class=header>Mission 23</span><span class=date> - The final showdown. Attack the enemy fortress and stop the enemy commander's escape.</span><br>
<span class=body>*The ex-president is holed up in his fortress and the enemy forces are making their last stand here. The odds are not in your favor, about 30+ enemy VTs, with two that regenerate from the elevators, two choppers which will regenerate from off map if you destroy them, about 20+ giraffes and Scylas (some which are placed in the moat so that you cannot hit them until you are almost on top of them), to top things off add a sprinkle of MG and cannon defensive turrets. If you manage to get past all of that, and that is a big if, a boss waits that has fire power like you have never seen before. <br>
You, on the other hand get your VT and five brain dead teammates. Go team!<br>
Here's how to do it: The 3rd generation VTs that you have access to have one gas tank. You can do it, but gas can be tight, (you can imagine how frustrating it will be when you finally kill the last boss then run out of gas and have to sit there) keep the override off when you don't need it and refuel before entering the elevator and on the second level and you should make it ok. If you feel lucky use a Regal N and bring a Pz-mis, HVM-la, and a cannon. If you want a ride with enough fuel to get you there and back, use the trustworthy, if a bit frail, Prominence M1, one fuel tank, main weapons missile and the weak cannon, sub weapon R-gun. The best choice is a Quasar or Juggernaut for a higher powered ride and a lot more armor and firepower (the Juggernaut makes even Desperado level difficulty easy). Load up on the cannon that does 1000 damage a shot! Also have about three or more supply runs available, less if you're good. To begin with there are your two teammates and a second VT group at the other corner of the map. Your teammates will trail behind you unless you tell them to go home or attack. Seeing as Tekki's AI is "Special", the other VT group will sit there and never move unless you happen to run close to where they are, (one triggered they will charge forward then get stuck trying to get around the big rock that is blocking their path, every time, highly advanced AI). Having such dependable teammates may temp you to bring them along but I find that they just get in the way most of the time. The only time I was ever glad to have them around was to distract the choppers which are just a nuisance really, (don't waste ammo on the choppers as they just come back). Instead lead the choppers towards your teammates and then let them play together for the rest of the mission. Next attack the lone VT group on this side of the right bridge. First take care of the enemy Scarface II then the two Vitzh. After they are destroyed prepare for your strafing run: The scene that awaits you is a moat with two bridges and tons of enemy VT's and turrets on the other side and mounted on the fortress. To make things even more interesting there are about 12 giraffes in the moat, their turrets when extended can make shots at you but unless you are really close to the edge of the moat you will not be able to hit them. If you want to take them out what you have to do is just that, get really close. Start on either side, (the right side is easier to start from), and (while moving fast enough not to get hit, around overdrive 3rd for the Prominence M1) while hugging the edges of the moat, take the giraffes out one by one. The Enemy VTs will shoot at you but they're a good distance away and as long as you don't slow down you should be safe from cannon fire, avoid missiles with chaff. Next once you have secured the right bridge, use your missiles and R-gun to take out the VT group of one Behemoth and two Vitzh. A good way to take out the Behemoths (on easier difficulty levels) is to launch two missiles, after the second one knocks him down squeeze off a rail gun shot to finish the job while he is immobile on the ground. After that use your cannon or MG to clean up the turrets, then you can re-supply if you need it (keep track of fuel as well). There are two entrances to the fortress: ramps towards the rear of each side. Take out any turrets as they will distract you and make your way down either side. If you took the right side you should only have to deal with a regal dress or two if you're unlucky maybe a Behemoth. In a long range battle the Behemoths should be your priority as they will launch devastating long-range artillery bombardments (keep your radar close range here so you can detect and dodge the incoming fire) as they hide behind the walls, try to get line of sight and wipe them out. At closer ranges the Regals are more deadly so in that case shift your attention to them. The Regals will fire missiles and cannon so keep the chaff ready, dodge the cannon fire and take them out when you can't get a clear shot at a Behemoth. After you clean up the VTs on the walls take out any turrets you haven't yet and re-supply. As long as you stay far away from the ramp and keep alert for artillery you should be able to re-supply just outside of the fortress. When you're ready, charge the ramp. If you did it right you should only have to deal with one Regal, there may or may not be constant artillery bombardment from the Behemoth on the other side of the base. Knock down the Regal with a R-gun then finish with the cannon. After the job is done a new Regal should be coming out of the nearby elevator, it's sleepy from it's hibernation and wont do much dodging or attacking for a bit so quickly knock it down with a R-gun shot then repeat with cannon, or get close and do it all with the cannon. When the fresh Regal is done exploding rush into the elevator and then take a deep breath, you're halfway there. Push the button and move to the next floor. [From here on out the FAQ assumes that you entered the fortress from the right side.] There will be tons of targets here but don't panic, they can't touch you yet, proceed to the corner, and target the missile spider around the corner. Pop a chaff and calmly walk forward destroying it with one hit as its missiles fly everywhere, while your chaff is still working target the other spider at the end of the hall and kill it too if you can reach it (rarely it will have wandered off behind yet another hall blocking your LOF). There is a Scarface II in the next alley over but ignore him and move towards the ramp leading down. Use the corner trick and lots of dodging (overdrive time) to keep your body safe and take out the giraffes below with the cannon. When they are destroyed run down avoiding any fire from the Scarface II behind you. As you climb up the ramp there will be a giraffe waiting for you to the right, and a Scarface II close by. Take them both out then hang a left at the end and take out another Scarface II which may or may not be there(If not proceed to the door switch, no need to wait for him). Halfway down there is a door and switch on the right side. Open it and use the corner trick and cannon to destroy the spiders inside, or just use a chaff and walk in shooting the helpless spiders. Walk through and exit to the left, take another left and (no, the flaming pit is not good, do not fall in) you're in the elevator again. Head to the right and wait for the first Regal of three to poke out behind the corner finish him with missiles, or just rush them all if you have enough rail gun left. the other two will stay back, rush them with the rail gun shots you have left and when the job is done open the door. If you are in a regal you might want to take the left way, same enemies but you have a little more distance between you and them. Proceed and you will find yourself outside. You can safely call for supplies here. Go back in and head to the center of the map, you should see a door, there are enemies waiting behind that door so pop some chaff as you open it. And take out the near-by 3 missile spiders first, then concentrate on the 3 VTs in the back. Back out for more supplies, you'll need the ammo. Then proceed in and  destroy the generator in the corner that is glowing to open the next door if you already haven't. To the left to the passageway you will find the next elevator. Open the first door and enter, get ready because the second door is automatic, it will open when you get close. Once it opens and the shock sets in, get ready for the biggest enemy you will ever face.<P>
<span class=header>BOSS : The Squared Eye</span><br>
<span class=body>When the door opens concentrate your fire on the left and right targets, after you get a shot off dodge behind the doorway either side. Turn on the Overdrive and dodge out in the open let off a shot then get behind the wall again. There is just enough space to hide but be careful not to get too close to the front wall as that may lead to you bumping into the doorway leaving you out in the open, and about 2 seconds later dead. On the other hand don't get too far away because then the rocket barrage that the boss unleashes will be able to hit you. If leave the cover of the door room and enter the room the boss will ram you which means instant death. The left and right arms should only take one big gun and a few cannon hits each. If you dodged to the left then take out the right arm first, then the other arm. 3rd generation VTs have tons of chaff but if you don't have any left make your dodges out then back again to the same side instead of sliding across to the opposite side. This will be more dangerous for cannon fire but will increase your chances of dodging missiles (tracking you from the one side to the other may arc their flight path so they will avoid the corner and make it to you). After the Boss fully wakes up you will have to deal with:Two Missiles: after the first 2 blow a succeeding set will be constantly launched, use chaff.<P>
<span class=body>Two Cannons: these are the hardest to see and the easiest to fall prey to, they hurt so even if you don't see anything coming at you keep dodging.One MG: there is a MG on the belly of the boss, it's always firing at you but you're at a safe distance by the doorway.<P>
<span class=body>Two Rockets: Normally these rocket turrets will be firing at a normal rate, however every few seconds they will go crazy and launch about 15 rockets in about a second. The rocket spread is significant so either be on your way, or snug behind a wall when it happens. Check the radar to see if it's safe to come out or not.<P>
<span class=body>EMG Pulse Attack: If your screen starts to go fuzzy and the boss looks like he's radio-active blue, then get behind a doorway! He's charging a pulse that will shut you down, if you're not behind cover when it happens, then it's all over.  Target the center target last. After you have beaten the center target a good while it will eventually disappear leaving you with nothing to lock on to. Don't panic just keep up your pattern of dodging from one side to the other and make your shots to the body manually as you slide past. You will also have the chance to rush in the room and hide behind the pillars on either side of the room. This is a valid way to fight the boss, but the boss will move to face your position. If you loose control even for a second you will be dead before you realize what happened. Continue to pound the Boss and eventually he will start spraying smoke, fire, and what looks like rail gun blasts to the sides then will fall apart. When he's done blowing up an hour later proceed to the hallway behind him and run down it, (do not tear the joysticks off the controller if you run out of gas here) take the elevator up. When the elevator door is opening search for a small target indicator which marks the president's escape VTOL. You made it this far don't blow the kill, the jet will only hold still for a second before lifting off so don't waste any time.<P>
<span class=body>Now you are treated to a different movie ending featuring the VTs in action. After that line up for your decoration and then it's back to business as usual.<br>
<span class=body>**There is an alternative, faster way to get in the base at the beginning but there are a few problems. First charge the first VT grouping on this side of the bridge with your cannon or just ignore them. Once they are taken care of, rush the right bridge, use missiles and cannon to clear your path but don't slow down. (If you want your teammates to accompany you into the compound you should take out the giraffes). Then keep running until you make it to the ramp, don't waste time just climb up and when you reach the top you should see a behemoth and a few regals to your left, elevator to the right. Pick the Regal that looks like the one and destroy it quickly with a rail gun blast or the next best thing. Once the new regal comes out of the elevator ignore the remaining VTs and go for the fresh regal and then dash in the elevator.This method is appealing because you can get there a lot faster and get out of the artillery danger zone quickly, if you're lucky (give them the "cover me" command) you may even have a teammate by your side drawing fire while fighting for the elevator. If so be very, very careful about friendly fire, I had a teammate plasma torch my Juggernaut from the rear and was dead before I knew what happened. Keep track of where they are, as teammates are just as deadly as enemies when you are in their LOF. The main problem with this method is there is no time to refuel, and the fighting by the elevator will be close range so you'll need a rail gun/powerful cannon, or some luck to line up some nice long range shots, two reasons that a 3rd generation VT regal dress N will have a hard time here.<br>
<span class=body>**There is also an alternative way to destroy the boss (kinda' takes the fun out of things though). Turn on overdrive and trigger the doors to open. Take out the left and right arms as fast as you can with most powerful weapon you have at your disposal (I think that destroying the arms will stop the boss from ramming you, either way it will be hard to target them from behind). Once they are gone make a dash in the room and through the pillars to the rear of the boss. He will slowly turn to face you but do your best to keep to his rear. Once you are behind him he will no be able to attack you, at all. Keep moving as necessary to stay behind him, as he will continue to turn to try and face you. Now pound away until he begs for mercy, one word of caution though, don't attack the heavily armed body as it will do no damage, aim for the back of its head. To tell if you are doing damage watch the HUD and see if where you are shooting registers as a "HIT" or a "MISS", only the hits are doing damage. As long as you don't mess up the entry, this is the best and safest way to defeat the boss. (I feel so stupid for the 20+ times I've forced myself to fight him the normal way). But remember, mess-up the entry or leave his arms in tact and you might as well just push the ejection button now to save yourself some time.<P align=center><a href=#top><span class=link>^ top</span></a><P>
