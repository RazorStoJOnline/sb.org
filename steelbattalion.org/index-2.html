<span class=body>The Killzone 3 Exoskeletons make a dope study for how a new Steel Battalion could be made using motion control.  I hate motion control, but in this case I think I could definitely make an exception.  And by "this case" I mean my imagination.<br><br>Link: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVF18EWgsuE>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVF18EWgsuE</a><p>

<span class=header>New Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor game for XBox 360 and Kinect?!</span><br><img src=greyPixel.gif width=100% height=1><br><span class=date>09.16.10</span><P>
<span class=body><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/screenshots/steel-battalion-heavy-armor-kinect/3368225/#/0">Check this out</a>. My first reaction was "HOLY CRAP THIS IS AWESOME!"  And then I was excited.  And then I thought about it and was concerned about the control scheme using Kinect instead of The Controller.  And then I watched the video, and the VTs look less like Steel Battalion and more like Chrome Hounds.  I think this needs much discussion in <a href="http://lineofcontact.net/forums/index.php">the forums</a>.<P>

<span class=body>It's official; they are going to be deploying a patch to unlock everything for free mode.  KingLeerUK alerted me to a post on the capcom forums where the following was stated:<P>
<span class=body>"I am happy to report that we plan to release a patch to unlock the items acquirable only by going online. We hope to have this patch available sometime shortly after the closure of Online Campaign Mode."<br>

<span class=body>Looks like Capcom has decided to take down the campaign servers at the end of the month.  It's a true shame.<P>
<span class=body>"As of Friday September 30th, 10:00AM-12:00PM PST, Capcom will be ending the online services for Campaign Mode of Steel Battalion. We appreciate your continued support of our product, and sincerely apologize for any inconveniences this may cause. Thank you for your understanding of this matter.<P>
<span class=body>However, we will continue services and support for both Free Mission Mode and System Link play."</span><P>

<span class=header>The Verdict is IN</span><br><img src=greyPixel.gif width=100% height=1><br><span class=date>11.11.04</span><P>
<span class=body>Halo 2 is out, and it is officially NOT devoid of giant devastating robots.  For this I give Halo 2 a high 5.  It has, however, officially made everyone stop playing LoC -- and for that I give Halo 2 a big F off.</span><P>

<span class=header>Capcom Updated Something.  SERIOUSLY!!</span><br><img src=greyPixel.gif width=100% height=1><br><span class=date>09.01.04</span><P>
<span class=body>Apparently, today when you start up the game, it'll ask you to download an update.  And yes ladies and gentlemen; the update is actually a minor (or major ... depending on how you look at it) network code fix.  Some people who could not play at all in the past have reported being able to play.  It's still a silly bandwidth hog (4 vs 4 and 5 vs 5 in your dreams you sissy) ... but it's opening its doors to more users with varying ISPs.  So THAT is certainly something to sing about.  Tralalala.</span><P>

<span class=body>Well, since tonberry asked for it in the <a href=http://www.steelbattalion.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=424><span class=link>forums</span></a> I figured I'd get myself together and finish the <a href=vts2.html><span class=link>VT Catalog</span></a> now that all the VTs are out.  And have been for months.  Shut up.  So everything's in there, I'm just missing some info on a couple weapons and images of the Earthshaker and the Jaralaccs NS-R that don't suck.  Rock!</span><P>

<span class=header>An apology.</span><br><img src=greyPixel.gif width=100% height=1><br><span class=date>04.16.04</span><P>
<span class=body>I recognize that it's been 3 weeks since my last update, and there are some massive gaping holes in all of the exciting elements of the site; like the VT catalog, and the map list etc.  I'm still waiting to close on my apartment, so I'm homeless and haven't turned on an xbox in 3 weeks.  I'm using Starbucks' bandwidth to write this.  So please forgive me, and know that updates are coming.  I miss you all dearly.</span><P>

<span class=body>For those of you who don't have the game (YET), I put up a section showing the <a href=locMaps.html><span class=link>maps</span></a> from Line of Contact.  You can get to it from the <a href=warfare.html><span class=link>online:loc page</span></a>. Also, "they" released a whole mess of new VTs (with some sexy new weapons) so the VT Catalog has been updated.  I'm still missing the Rapier.</span><P>

<span class=body>The good "DareDevil" has blessed us with an article about how to kick ass if you're a n00b.  You can find it <a href=n00b.html><span class=link>here</span></a> or by clickin' the link to it from the <a href=manual.html><span class=link>manual page</span></a>.

<span class=body>Now "they" have told us that they shall officially take the game down every day for a half an hour' from 6:30am to 7:00am.  They've also acknowledged that their game is seriously F'd up; as stated at <a href=http://www.tekki.jp/><span class=link>tekki.jp</span></a>.  And I quote: "Being trouble at the time of campaign mode playing has been ascertained, presently we do the correction job."  Lord knows I'm comforted!

<span class=body>Seriously.  Check out the <a href=warfare.html><span class=link>Online:LoC</span></a> section for a wonderful translation of the latest update they're planning on march 7th (from tekki.jp -- because capcom USA doesn't know how to use a translator, or change its web page).  In other news, I rebuilt the warfare section so it's now more organized, and added a <a href=commTutorial.html><span class=link>Communications Tutorial</span></a> section because I know a lot of people are confused about how the hell to talk to people in the middle of a match.</span><P>

<span class=body>I can only hope that by "maintenence" they mean "we're fixing the busted game we released."  If so, then woot dang!  It's battle time!  Taken from tekki.jp, and posted in the forums by Sierex (translated lusciously by Babelfish):</span><P>

<span class=body>In the <a href=warfare.html><span class=link>Online:LoC</span></a> section I put some information regarding the LoC connectivity issues.

<span class=header>Updates and stfu.</span><br><img src=greyPixel.gif width=100% height=1><br><span class=date>02.29.04</span><P>
<span class=body>I put up some <a href=screenshotsLOC.html><span class=link>fun images</span></a> of BoxCar and me doing some damage to a poor soul in a Vitzh.  Campaign mode still seems busted, but fortunately the Japanese seem to know, and have fessed up to the game having serious problems.  This is a good thing (thanks to <a href=http://www.steelbattalion.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=125><span class=link>Abou 3bbas</span></a> for easing my heart).  Update: I overhauled the <a href=controller.html><span class=link>controller</span></a> section to include pics of the old and new controllers side by side, and a new diagram of the entire controller, as well as adding LoC functionality to the button explanations via asterisks.  Clever, I know.  I'm also slowly but surely eliminating all the parts of the  page that have "speculative" information about the game, except where still applicable (like anything regarding Jarlaccs and Right Brothers etc).</span><P>

<span class=header>The Game.  THE GAME.</span><br><img src=greyPixel.gif width=100% height=1><br><span class=date>02.27.04</span><P>
<span class=body>Okay; so FINALLY many of us got our hands on the game today.  I played for 14 hours straight, I'm proud to say.  I'll be working on a full review soon; but at the moment I'll just say this: The game freakin' rocks.  There are some MAJOR disappointments in many areas of the game, but once you get used to them (like not playing campaign mode AT ALL) the free missions are an absolute blast.  In other news, there's an interview with me (whoa!  Me?!) over at <a href=http://www.xequted.com/><span class=link>xequted.com</span></a>.  Check it out and read all about "it" and stuff.<a href=http://www.xequted.com/interviews.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1077908027&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=10&amp;><span class=link>The Interview</span></a>.
