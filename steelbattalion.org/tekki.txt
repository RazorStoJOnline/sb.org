**********  I  BASICS  **********

1) INTRO/STORY 
Tekki is a Mech simulation game where you pilot lumbering, 24 meter-tall VTs (Vertical 
Tanks) in a series of combat missions based in the near future. What makes this game 
special is the effort the designers invested into creating a game that makes you feel 
like you are really trapped in the cramped cockpit and controlling said VT. The most 
obvious element is the gigantic controller, which allows for control and a feeling 
of immersion unlike anything I have ever experienced in a game before. The controller 
also put Tekki at the 18,000 JYE price range, limiting sales, making it artistically 
a triumph, and economically a failure. As I'm sure that the numbers for this game 
came as no surprise, thanks to Capcom for taking the hit and making this game.
Tekki is a single player game, you cannot link with another X-box and there is no 
network support. There are plans for a sequel/add-on for the game that will allow 
network play. That is another game and no information on that will be included in 
this FAQ.

The story goes something like: In the year 2080, a south Asian territory, Hai Shi 
Dao declares independence from the local super power PRF (Pacific Rim Forces) and 
invades neighboring territories while seizing all foreign assets within its borders.  
During the invasions you and the "Sarge" (who looks like he's made of greasy clay) 
who were engaged in a fascinating dialogue (which is thankfully the only dialogue 
of any length in the game), get interrupted by the surprise attack on your base. In 
the chaos, you of course jump in the new prototype PRF's VT which was lying around 
for testing or something, and fight off the invaders in the introduction "tutorial". 
You then join the counter invasion force against the Hai Shi Dao army and fight your 
way through the 10 counterattack missions. After that you get the chance to 
participate in missions 11-24 with a recycled story & maps (with the exception of 
the about three maps). In other words Tekki's story is yet another rehash of the same 
unoriginal boring plot elements that we've all seen before, thankfully the designers 
stopped pretending that your character was part of the story around mission 1, and 
you revert back to your role as faceless cannon fodder (despite the claymation sage 
who taunts you with useless advice every time you fail a mission).
But you didn't buy this game for the story right?
 
2) CONTROLS
Finish bolting the controller together and get things hooked up, now what do all these 
buttons do? (Just a note, but the right joystick is supposed to be that stiff, your 
controller is not broken.)

[First off navigate pre-game menus with the camera hat switch on the left controller 
and select with main weapon on the right controller, back out of menus by pressing 
lock-on on the right controller.]

*RIGHT BLOCK*
Joystick - controls the aim of your weapons.
Trigger (Joystick) - activates the sub-weapon/manipulator.
Lock On (Joystick) - press to lock on when you aim cursor is over a lockable enemy.
Main Weapon (Joystick) - use to fire your main weapon.
Eject Button - press to eject, (you will loose current VT) useful to avoid your pilot 
becoming very dead when the VT explodes.
Hatch Close Button - press to close the VTs cockpit.
Start Button - press after cockpit is closed to boot OS.
Ignition Button - press to start main engine after subsystems have been activated.
Open/Close Button - press to retract/open the radar sub-screen located on the top 
of the view screen.
Map Zoom Button - use to toggle between the two levels of map zoom.
Sub-Screen Mode Button - use to toggle between the different modes. (map/kill 
count/objective/team status/VT status)
Camera Mode Button - use to toggle between the different camera modes. 
(front/rear/sky/target)
Zoom Buttons - use to zoom your main view screen in and out.

*CENTER BLOCK*
F1 Button - used for mission specific actions and disengaging the extra armor. (if 
you need it, it will flash.)
Tank Detach Button - used to release empty gas tanks as they are expended. (your VT 
will move faster if it is lighter, however a refuel chopper will refill empty reserve 
tanks if you still have it so don't release unless you have enough gas to get home.)
FSS Button - used for activating the targeting forecast system (it will lead your 
shots based on enemy movement, not always the best choice.)
F2 Button - used for mission specific actions (if you need it, it will flash.)
Override Button - Override the safety locks and push your engine to the max (faster 
movement and better performance but you will burn gas faster).
Manipulator Button - used for toggling the sub-weapon and manipulator arm (used for 
opening doors, picking up cows & stuff.)
F3 Button - used for mission specific actions (if you need it, it will flash. Never 
once used in this game.)
Night Vision Button - toggle night vision on/off.
Line Change Button - press to change the color of the HUD lines (useful for seeing 
the green HUD lines on a green night vision screen, but beware most colors are 
one-toned, i.e. allies are the same color as enemies).
Communication Tuner - used to change between five COM frequencies.
Communication Button 1 - used to begin communication with whichever frequency your 
tuner is set to, also to confirm reception of a message.
Communication Button 2 - used to ask for a repeat of the previous message.
Communication Button 3 - used to ask for supplies.
Communication Button 4 - Used to ask for help until mission 10, programmable after 
mission 10.
Communication Button 5 - programmable after mission 10.
Wash Button - press to wash the main camera's lens, clearing away dirt from falling 
or enemy fire.
Extinguisher Button - press to put out internal fires (will flash when necessary)
Chaff Button - press to release chaff to confuse enemy missiles (the button will flash 
when a missile is locked on you.)
Main Weapon Button - press to cycle through available main weapons.
Sub Weapon Button - press to cycle through available sub weapons.
Magazine Change Button - press to reload main weapon's magazine (will flash when 
necessary)

*LEFT BLOCK*
Joystick - use to turn your VT left and right.
Joystick Hat - use to move your main camera.
5 Toggle Switches - used in the VT power-up sequence.
Gearshift - use to change gears (R, N, 1-5). You can move in any gear but the 
acceleration and top speeds are different for each gear (putting it in reverse while 
moving forward will trip your VT).

*PEDAL BLOCK*
Gas Pedal - gas.
Brake Pedal - brakes.
Dodge Pedal - use to make your VT dodge enemy fire. You can dodge at any time and 
at any speed as long as you have enough hydraulic power built up, the length you hold 
down the pedal determines the size of the leap. Press while in gears N-5 and you will 
jump forward, while in reverse you will jump backwards, if you press the left joystick 
left/right and press the dodge pedal you will leap left/right in any gear.


3) GAME MECHANICS
Create a pilot, begin the campaign, set up your VT and start the mission. As you clear 
missions and destroy enemies you are rewarded with supply and battle points. Supply 
points are used to buy: supply chopper runs, and new VTs. (any VT purchased during 
a campaign will be useable in free mode). Battle points are rewarded in the same manner  

as supply points however they are like experience points, when you get enough you 
will raise a rank (for a list of ranks and point values see below). 3rd generation 
VTs can only be piloted by higher ranks (starting at Second Lieutenant, if I remember 
correctly.) so you may want to repeat the first scenario a few times before moving 
on to the harder missions as you will need the extra points in the later missions 
(not to mention unlocking the 3rd generation VTs). After you complete a scenario you 
are given a choice of restarting the original scenario at one of three difficulty 
levels or starting the second scenario set (the veteran difficulty level will become 
available after you clear it once.)
In addition to rank you can also receive decorations for earning more than 12000 
command points on a single mission. After you receive 10 decorations then you will 
unlock the Rapier VT.
 
* Command Points - Rank *
0 - Corporal
25000 - Lieutenant 
50000 - Staff Sergeant
85000 - Sergeant Major
120000 - Warrant Officer
160000 - Second Lieutenant (You get permission to use 3rd generation VTs)
220000 - First Lieutenant
300000 - Captain
400000 - Major
550000 - Lieutenant Colonel (I could use the start & ignition full screen trick from 
around here)
800000 - Colonel (You can use the juggernaut VT at this rank)

(I have, at the time of writing this section, around 2,500,000 command points and 
70 decorations, so I think it's safe to say that there are no ranks above Colonel.)
Note that the ranks are a little different for the "Steel Battalion"version of 
Tekki:

80000 - Sergeant
120000 - Warrant Officer
160000 - Second Lieutenant
220000 - First Lieutenant
300000 - Capitan
400000 - Major
550000 - Lieutenant Colonel
800000 - Colonel
(Seeing as the important ranks have not changed point value this has no effect on 
gameplay.)


* Difficulty Levels *
The game offers six difficulty levels, the difference is enemies take more hits on 
higher difficulty, the projectiles start moving faster, and the point system is 
different.
Rookie - Command Points = points x 0.5 / Supply Points = points x 2.0 
Normal - Command Points = points x 1.0 / Supply Points = points x 1.0
Veteran - Command Points = points x 1.2 / Supply Points = points x 0.8
Magnum Force - Command Points = points x 1.8 / Supply Points = points x 0.6
Armageddon - Command Points = points x 2.5 / Supply Points = points x 0.5

In other words you won't be going up rank very fast in rookie mode, but you'll be 
hard up for supply points in Armageddon mode.

Also, beating mission 23 in Normal mode shows a screen asking you to beat it in Veteran 
mode and unlocked a movie viewer in the main menu config screen. When you beat Veteran 
you get a similar screen while unlocking Desperado and a Japanese voice select option 
in the main menu config screen. Beating Desperado unlocks yet another screen and 
Magnum Force mode as well as unlocks the crouch code. Beating Magnum Force unlocks 
yet another screen and asking you to challenge Armageddon. Beating Armageddon shows 
you a screen that thanks you for seeing the battle through to the end.

* Free Mission Mode *
The free mission option will appear after you have beaten mission 1. You can replay 
any mission that you have played in the past and use any VT that you have unlocked 
in the game (doesn't matter if the pilot who got that far is dead or alive). In the 
free mission mode you will have the option to hear the briefing, config, and complete. 
Beating levels in either rookie or normal difficulty will unlock both difficulty 
levels in the free mission mode. However you will have to beat Veteran (and higher) 
difficultly missions to unlock them in the free mode. The reinforcement screen is 
not available as there are no points in the free mode (that means that there are no 
supply runs in free mode.)

4) VT (Vertical Tank)
The lumbering VTs that you will be piloting and battling with are called Vertical

*Notes*
Unlock the Rapier VT by getting 10 decorations. But why the designers locked such 
a wimpy VT, at such a high goal, (I had 770000 command pts when I got the 10th 
decoration) I will never understand. It has two new weapons but that's the only draw.

*Notes*
Find this VT hidden on the third level of mission 7 or 17. The Quasar will give you  

the enemy version of the rail gun as well as some mean cannon weapons.

-Juggernaut-
Manufacturer: Lycoming D. S.
Generation: 3rd
Type: Medium
Cost: 30000

*Features*
F.S.S.: Y
Override: Y
Stealth: Y
Optional Armor: N
Fuel Tank: 0

*Stats* 

Max Speed:13.5
Stabilizer:13.5
Durability:10.5
Torque:5
Veering:12
Fuel load:13
MAX load:36
STD load:32

*Notes*
Handles better than anything else out there, tough as nails, and has a huge weight 
limit with top class weaponry. If you are really having trouble with the second 
scenario you can repeat the Veteran missions 1-10 until you have unlocked this beauty. 
The rest will be easy. Unlock the Juggernaut by reaching the Colonel Rank at 800000 
command points. The VT slots will grow by one, leading me to believe that perhaps 
there are more VTs to be had, Prominence M2?

and knock down the enemy VT with a direct hit. Be careful as you will be unable to 
lock on and use your main weapon when a close combat sub weapon is equipped.

*22b-PT*
Type: Plasma torch
Firepower:150
Weight:02
Ammo(Clips):0(0)
Range:000-100
Note: Close combat weapon, line it up and pull the trigger, your VT will slide forward

*Stan-L*
Type: Shock Rod
Firepower:10
Weight:01
Ammo(Clips):0(0)
Range:000-100
Note: Close combat weapon, line it up and pull the trigger, your VT will slide forward 
and knock down the enemy VT with a direct hit. To make up for the weak damage, this 
weapon supposedly shuts down the targeted enemy VT with an electro shock. However 
I didn't notice any big difference between the time it took the target VT to get 
back up again. Be careful as you will be unable to lock on and use your main weapon 
when a close combat sub weapon is equipped.

*AVTMT *
Type: Artillery
Firepower: 600
Weight:5
Ammo(Clips): 20(0)
Range:025-200
Note: Direct hit is not necessary: shells break into cluster bombs to inflict area 
damage. This is the only artillery weapon in the game capable of in flight tracking. 
Despite that it misses most of the time. Good for taking out groupings of immobile 
non-VT targets though.

*AVTM*

Firepower:300
Weight:02
Ammo(Clips):12(0)
Range:000-015

*NPM*
Type: Flamethrower

Range:050-100
Note: Direct hits may start fires inside of the target VT. 

*MM*
Type: Extra Armor Artillery
Firepower:500
Weight:07
Ammo(Clips):36(0)
Range:025-125
Note: This weapon comes with the extra armor that is equipable by the Prominence VT. 
It fires a barrage of unguided mini missiles that arc like low altitude artillery 
fire. Unlike most artillery that you can use, its fast and does good damage with a 
hit (looks cool too). The only problem is the weight of the extra armor and the lack 
of ammo (each trigger squeeze fires a barrage of multiple missiles) makes it a weapon 
reserved for fun in the free missions. Disengage in-mission with the F1 button.

*AVTDT*
Type: Missile
Firepower: 1500
Weight:08
Ammo(Clips):6(0)
Range:100-250
Note: Dubbed the "VT killer", the name and damage says it all.

*Rail-G* (allied type)
Type: Rail gun
Firepower: 2000
Weight:12
Ammo(Clips):10(0)
Range:000-250
Note: Nothing beats the rail gun, NOTHING. The weight, limited ammo, hydraulics drain, 
and slow aiming movement are restrictive, but one shot will topple most VTs and  
Rail-G speed and firepower can't be beat.

*Rail-G* (enemy type)
Type: Rail gun
Firepower: 2500
Weight:12
Ammo(Clips):8(0)
Range:000-250
Note: Enemy Rail gun recovered from the prototype Quasar VT hidden in missions 7 & 
17. There is a pause between the moment you pull the trigger and when you fire. (This 
actually helps more than hinders as enemy VTs will dodge when you pull the trigger, 
then the charging gun will track and make the hit)  It does more damage, but only 
carries 8 shots at the same weight.

*Smoke*
Type: Smoke screen
Firepower:0
Weight:01
Ammo(Clips):12(0)
Range:000-015
Note: For a very brief moment enemy units will be unable to target you.

********  III VT OPERATION  ********


8) Survival
Don't Get Hit - Sounds easy enough right? It is as long as you keep control of the 
battle. Death usually comes when you are being attacked from different angles or 
don't know where enemy fire is coming from. Things you should keep track of are:
Ammo - Keep a general idea of how many bullets you have left. If you don't have enough 
to take out the next group of enemies then back off and call for supplies. If you 
can't stop for supplies get in close and make your last shots count.
Distance - When you are selecting arms for your VT pay attention to the effective 
ranges for the weapon. Firing missiles inside of 1000 meters will result in a pleasing 
explosion but no damage. Firing a cannon with a 1500 limit at a target 1700 away will 
result in a "hit" and some pretty sparks, but again, no damage. 
Enemy ID - When you lock on see that name displayed there? As most enemy VT types 
share the same load out you will be able to tell who to destroy first and who to keep 
your eye on for incoming bundles of death (i.e. rail gun shots both hurt more, and 
are harder to dodge than a rocket due to projectile speed). As such, VT type dictates 
what kind of projectiles will be flying towards you, and how alert you should be.
Dodging - With a little practice you will be dodging pretty much everything from rail 
gun slugs to IR missiles. Keep track of which way your VT is facing and then use the 
left joystick or gearshift to jump in one of four directions.
Chaff ? It's ok to dodge or ignore shoulder-mounted, or chopper AVT missiles (Most 
non-VT sized land units do no real damage until you get to Veteran level), but the 
bigger ones that enemy VTs throw at you hurt if you miss the dodge. You have tons 
of chaff, use it.
Facing - Don't get hit from behind or above, it hurts. If you're running away, pay 
attention to your short range radar to track incoming shots. Also you would be 
surprised at what you can deflect with the sides of your VT, protect the center, which 
contains the fragile human pilot. Also you are a lot harder to hit when you are running 
to the side rather that directly at the enemy.
Falling Down - Happens to us all, use the dodge pedal to keep your balance if you 
notice the fall fast enough. If you fall, brake then, wait until your speed is under 
10kmh and then press the gas pedal and you will stand up. Despite all that grinding 
and banging you hear, falling down does no damage to your VT. If you have override 
now would be a good time to engage it as you are easy to hit as your VT starts 
acceleration from zero. Also with VTs with high torque value be careful with the 
override, as starting out in higher gears will topple your VT from the pure 
acceleration. Falling down is also a way to avoid non guided projectiles, but the 
vulnerability you display getting up makes it a last resort.
Surroundings - VTs are big and clumsy as such they do not fight well in cramped spaces, 
or in clusters. I have died countless times because of moronic teammates blocking 
the way, impairing movement, and knocking me down. Buildings will normally not topple 
your VT (unless you had a running start) but will keep you from dodging so when 
approaching enemy VTs keep an idea of what's around you. There are rare times where 
walls and buildings come in handy. You can edge your VT up to a corner and fire at 
targets while keeping your body behind the wall as your cannon arm fires from a 
position slightly right of your VT. This of course is a handicap if you are approaching 
a corner in the opposite direction.
F.S.S. - The FSS is nice and all, but it has its flaws: giraffes like to move around 
a lot but never go anywhere. The FSS will compensate for their desire to move, and 
as a result miss most of the time. FSS will also be late in fixing aim for when a 
VT dodges, keep a close eye on where your guns are pointing before pulling the trigger, 
especially for weapons with limited ammo and long reload times like the rail gun. 
"Friendly Fire"- The so called AI of Tekki manages to get the VTs to target and 
shoot at things, but don't expect teammates to worry about whether you're in the 
LOF (line of fire) or not. This is especially dangerous when you have a friendly 
targeting a VT that you are closing in on with a hand to hand weapon with. This lack 
of intelligence also can work to your advantage if you line your enemies up, they 
will have no qualms with shooting their friends in the back.

9) Override
Override is your friend, as long as you have the gas to play with it. Unavailable 
in the earlier VTs this easily forgotten feature is one of the single most important 
buttons in the game. Oh, override let me count the ways in which I love you:
- Override will put you at normal 5th gear speeds at around 3rd.
- When you fall and are getting up, and the bullets are closing in, it is important 
to be moving fast as soon as possible. Override will double your acceleration.
- Dodge all day, deplete the hydraulic pressure as much as you want, overdrive will 
make more. (As long as fuel holds up...)
- Super strong hydraulics translates into a boosted R-gun firing rate (about the same 
speed as a cannon!). All that and without that period of vulnerability (where you 
cannot dodge due to insufficient hydraulic power) that is experienced with normal 
engine speed!
Yes, Overdrive is your friend.
The 3rd generation VTs move like a second generation in override mode. As such, it 
is tempting to save gas and move normally. However in a real battle, better turn the 
override on and move the gearshift down a few clicks, because for all of their improved 
performance you will still find yourself wanting in the hydraulics area.

10) Communication
Communication is simple, and with the exception of calling for supplies, worthless.
The dial allows you to tune in to 5 different channels, the 5 buttons on the top of 
the center block allow you to communicate. When you have an incoming message the 
frequency will flash and an alarm will sound. When tuned to a frequency first press 
button one to start a conversation, after it has begun the selectable choices will 
flash. Flashing buttons are as follows. 1=confirmation of the message, 2=repeat 
message, 3=call for supplies (try asking for supplies from a different channel than 
wagon master), 4=Call for help from Oscar 1 (missions 1-10) or command X-ray member 
as you pre-programmed in set-up screen (missions 11-23), 4= contact Black widow in 
mission 16, or command X-ray member as you pre-programmed in set-up screen (missions 
11-15 & 17-23).
Below is a COM chart listing the missions and who will be at what frequencies.

11) Supplies
Use COM Channel 2 to contact the wagon master, after establishing contact press the 
flashing third COM button to request supplies. The supply chopper will then enter 
from the side of the map and proceed to the location that you made the supply request 
from. If you are not in the area the chopper will wait for a moment then leave (in 
this case you will not be charged for the call). If you move towards the approaching 
chopper to try and meet it halfway it will ignore you and move to the point you made 
the transmission from before stopping and deciding to look for you. (To sum things 
up hold still and wait for the chopper for the fastest possible re-supply.
When re-supply begins your targeting cursor will be disabled and all weapons functions 
will be paralyzed for the duration of the process. You will be able to move and the 
chopper will follow you to the best of its ability, however running away and dodging 
will halt the re-supply temporarily until the chopper can catch up to you or you return 
to it's position.
Re-supply choppers are fragile things, when they enter the map they will do so at 
high speed and altitude which makes them very difficult to shoot down. However while 
they are refueling you they will be slow and an easy target for enemy units, be 
especially careful of enemy choppers and MG turrets which will more often than not 
ignore you and target the chopper.
If a supply chopper is downed or you run away from it before the supply is completed 
you will be charged for the supply run (and get an angry message from the Japanese 
wagon master, or a whiney one from the English guy.)
There is another trick you can pull with the chopper nearby. If you're fighting and 
running out of ammo and the chopper is approaching let it start to refuel you. Your 
weapons will be disabled for the duration of the refuel but put the gearshift in 1-5 
and make a dodge forward. The re-supply will halt and you will be able to fire a few 
shots. After you get the rail gun and missiles off then put it in reverse and back 
up to where you started, the chopper will once again start to refuel you and refill 
your ammo supply. This trick is good for battles where ammo runs out before gas. But 
be careful if you try this too close to the enemy they will down your chopper and 
you'll have to call another.

********  IV MISSION WALKTHROUGH  ********


12) CAMPAIGN 1

*HAI SHI DAO 2080*
If you have a new pilot this campaign will begin with the "Tutorial" which doesn't 
teach you squat, it's just an easy mission and not a tutorial at all. After you have 
completed mission 10 and select this scenario again you will begin at mission 1. As 
long as you don't get too cocky on mission 9 and take mission 10 step by step you 
should have no problem repeating this scenario set over and over to gain supply points 
and gain rank. I would suggest playing through at least twice (more if you want to 
pilot the 3rd generation from the beginning) before moving on to the second scenario, 
as it starts off easy but gets hard fast.
Also, you get the rail gun for mission 8, and after you beat mission 10 you can repeat 
the first scenario enabling a VT on mission 1 with a rail gun and missiles. This changes 
things drastically, as you no longer have to tip-toe around the battlefield, rather 
you see an enemy VT, and then it becomes very dead, very quickly. As such for missions 
1-7 there is a section describing how you should change your strategy to adapt with 
the new firepower at your disposal. 

Format for mission walkthroughs is as displayed below:
Mission # - (mission contents.)(Clear requirements.) 
*(How you do it.)
**(How you do it with bigger guns, for missions 1-7)
***(Any other secrets or stuff you should know.)

Let's begin:

Tutorial - Destroy attacking forces. Destroy enemy VTs.
*Power up your VT and take out the VT that is breaking down the door, exit and take 
out the remaining VT to your left to clear the level. Spray the troops at your feet 
with MG fire if it makes you happy, the giraffes are the only other thing in the level 
that can hurt you but they are not necessary to clear the level.

Mission 1 - Storm the beach and destroy enemy forces. Destroy 70% of enemy forces. 
*The only things that can hurt you here are the giraffes and VTs in between the towers 
and the enemy VT/giraffe clusters to the upper far right and left corners after you 
pass the main wall.
**Same drill, the enemy just has less time to be afraid before they become dead.

Mission 2 - Your convoy is ambushed by a new VT with Artillery capabilities. Destroy 
all new type VTs.
*Power up, and exit the box you're in. Zoom your map out and see as you proceed forward 
and to the right there is a ramp to climb up to the top of the mesa. Climb up and 
take out the Vortex VTs to clear the mission. You can take them out from below with 
cannon fire but it takes forever.
**Exit the box, and make a U-turn to the left, target and destroy the VT out there 
with a rail gun hit, next make your way to the other side of the transports and target 
the Vortexes at the top of the mesas. Use missiles to take them out. (Notice how the 
missiles will fly up to match altitude with target, then continue moving forward, 
this knowledge comes in very handy in later missions.)

Mission 3 - Charge the City. Make it to the check point to clear the mission.
*The path straight ahead that you are supposed to take involves you crossing a bridge 
which is easily shot out by enemy (and friendly) fire. When it goes, so do you into 
the water and to your death. No thank you. Instead move to the right and you should 
be able to see on your radar where there is a huge crossing for the river. There are 
enemy artillery units bombarding the area so if you are moving slow you will get hit. 
Back up as far as you need to and get a running start you should be in top gear and 
at full speed when you hit the water. If you do it right you should be across the 
river before you know it. When you reach the other side you can take out the enemy 
VTs if you want but it is unnecessary. B-line to the city and head straight. As you 
enter the City there is a group of two Vitzh and a Scarface. Take them out or ignore 
them as you please but make it to the edge of the map before your mission time runs 
out. Only one spot will trigger a clear mission, look for the tower as a landmark 
(you should see it from where the Scarface was) and head towards it.
**You've got big guns now. Stay off the bridge unless you're feeling lucky and take 
the VTs out at your leisure as you make your way to the check point. Overdrive will 
help you wade through the water quickly. One final word of caution: if you have the 
Autobot code enabled DO NOT cross the water in the crouched mode, you will cause a 
water death. 

Mission 4 - You sunk my Battleship! Sink the Battleship in dock.
*Move forward from your starting position, and take the bridges when crossing 
platforms. Towards the end there will be panels between the platforms that a light 
VT can cross, but they can be shot out and it's not worth the risk or the sacrifice 
in firepower you make for the light VT. Machine gun down the 3 missile boats patrolling 
this side or keep the chaff handy. As you reach the last platform take out the 
surrounding VTs while being careful to stay out of the Battleship's main gun range. 
After your path is clear make a dash to the square hanger building to the left of 
the battleship. This building can take unlimited damage so use it to hide behind as 
you concentrate your fire on the ship's two main guns. After they are destroyed you 
can destroy the smaller guns on the side or just concentrate fire on the ship's hull. 
Then sit back and enjoy the spectacle of the Battleship going down.
**Same drill, except the battleship will be going down a lot faster with the rail 
gun. Remember that the ship has nothing lockable so use your missiles on the VTs before 
you get there. Also take the extra second to line up your first two rail gun shots 
to take out the two main guns facing you, once they are gone you are 100% safe as 
the small turrets on the side don't have the effective range to reach you and do 
any damage.

Mission 5 - Parts recovery. Pick up the three crates.
*There are a few weak enemies scattered about, and a bunch of little soldiers that 
will try to scratch your paintjob. Take out the enemy VTs then use the rest of the 
time to search for the three crates. They will be on the back of a truck and as you 
get close you should see an orange hexagon where you have to grab it with the 
manipulator arm. Once you have it in the arm press the manipulator arm button again 
to put it away, get the other two and you're done. The crates are scatter around 
but a general guide is get the first one close to the first VT you spot, the other 
two are located at the far ends of the map one straight ahead and the other to the 
left of the second crate. Play with the cows or give the village a sprinkling of machine 
gun fire if you get bored (those huts must be filled with explosives because just 
one MG round will turn them into a raging inferno). 
**Same drill, swifter death.

Mission 6 - Enemy base search. Find the base then run like a girl when the enemy VTs 
start pouring out of the door.
*(it's a good idea to bring extra gas for this one as it involves lots of running 
and dodging.) Progress forward taking out enemies as they show themselves. You will 
hit a wall so veer right and take the narrow canyon passage. After a while you will 
come to a three way intersection, continue forward and destroy the VT there to make 
your escape easier, this will be your escape route, U-turn and continue down the third 
way, at the opening there will be 3 VTs waiting for you. (Some people have mailed 
me about having trouble with getting pass the VTs in the narrow canyon pass, if you 
are having trouble fighting normally you can equip a howitzer and take them out that 
way as well. The artillery shells will arc over the canyon walls and hit even without 
LOS) Next turn right, and head into the open area, destroy the lone VT without getting 
too close to the base door. Call for supplies if you need the gas. Next position 
yourself so you can run close to the door and trigger the event, the door will open 
and Argus will ask you to run away. Overdrive time. Run like a scared child, weave 
to avoid canon fire, chaff the missiles. If you're feeling lucky you can back out  

of the canyon while fighting off the attacking VTs, but you had better be good if 
you want to make it out alive. Head back out the canyon passage and take the escape 
route, after running for a while you will clear the mission.
**Just on an off note, this is one of the rare opportunities that you have to use 
the AVTM (mine weapon) on. As you back away from the door drop a few mines, when the 
enemy VTs come charging after you they will be tripped up by the mines.
**Same drill, just seems a lot easier for some reason. You will be good enough and 
will have the firepower to fight the VTs that come out of the base but they will 
continually re-spawn so if you do decide to do some damage before leaving, do so away 
from the base so there will be a gap from when they spawn at the base entrance and 
from when they catch up and start shooting at you. Destroy all you want, they will 
make more.

Mission 7 - Night attack. Enter the base and enter and then destroy the VT in the 
last room.
*You can use your night vision here but it may hinder more than help in the open, 
best to save it for inside the base's dark hallways. Also 2nd generation night vision 
is green, so is your HUD, time to use the line color change button to re-coordinate 
to something a little easier to see. Or just leave it off altogether, I know you want 
to use it but you really don't need it to navigate, and the enemies are all very 
easy to spot with the big green box around them against the night background. Proceed 
to the base entrance taking out enemy VTs as you progress, this time the placement 
is different and there are less VTs. Once you reach the entrance and secure the area 
call for a supply chopper (you should have at least one extra tank for this mission, 
you can do it with one but leave the override off when you don't need it) and gas 
up. Use the manipulator arm to operate the door switches and enter, ignore the fleeing 
jeeps and proceed to the right, see that smoldering VT? That should be a clue, open 
the door and standing on the other side at point blank will be an enemy VT, knock 
him down with a few cannon shots (or a plasma torch if you have it) while protecting 
your body behind the doorway. Run down the hall and be ready to target the missile 
spider that comes around the corner to the left. Target with FSS and fire before he 
rounds the corner and you should destroy it before any missiles come your way. Proceed 
to the left and enter the elevator, operate switch with arm from the inside. When 
you get out you'll see what friendly VTs do when they're not walking in circles, 
that's right blowing up. Get in about override 3rd and strafe the giraffes on the 
other side, it's best to take them out now rather than later. Open the door at the 
end, ignore the two rooms ahead of you (enemy VT in each) and proceed to the right 
also ignore the foot soldiers. Open the door and run to the end, enter the elevator 
and proceed. When you exit again ignore the troops at your feet and run forward, two  

spiders will com out of the hallways, first from the right then the left as you run 
forward, use chaff if they have time to get a shot off. At the end of the hallway 
there will be a door. Open it and enter to find another door, open it as well and 
prepare for the last fight. Inside the next room will be a VT, its tough (took two 
rail gun hits and kept going) and dodges a lot (read: VT on major crack), so don't 
expect a fast kill. Fight defensively and use the doorway to protect your body while 
you wear him down. Do not let him corner you if he gets too close keep track of which 
way you are open to dodge, the plasma torch attack is easy to see coming so dodge 
it and then make him pay. Destroy the VT to clear the mission.
**If you've got the extra gas and ammo check out the small room to your left as you 
enter the second floor of the base, in the back of the room you will find a VT-sized 
box with a switch. Inside is a Quasar VT. You'll receive a COM from Argus then the 
Quasar will be useable from the next mission. (Similar VT boxes are located in the 
other room as well as the 2 rooms on level 3 but they are all empty.) (Note that the 
Quasar is in that room on your FIRST ATTEMPT, if you do not complete the mission the 
first time and try again, then the quasar is probably in another room, either on the 
same level or the one below.)

Mission 8 - The hunt. Destroy all enemy VTs.
*Here we get the Rail Gun and go out to hunt a few fleeing enemy VTs. Hunt them down 
before they escape, just a few Vitzh and Scarfaces, you've got a rail gun slug for 
each VT, easy prey for your new toy.

Mission 9 - VT battle. Destroy 70% of enemy forces.
*The buck stops here, join the biggest VT battle you've ever been a part of (despite 
the presence of friendly VTs, be prepared to do all the work yourself). The Enemy 
VT's in the front are all weak (Vortex and Scarface/Vitzh groupings), clean them 
up at your leisure with rail gun and missiles then move on to the bigger ones in the 
rear(be careful the groups are a little bigger here). When attacking the two groupings 
in the rear be careful of a stray Behemoth that may be lurking to the side, don't 
rely on your radar and keep your camera moving searching for possible targets. If 
you get damaged back off and call for another supply run, 2000 points in extra supplies 
is cheaper than buying a new VT and doing it again.

Mission 10 - Assault on the capital. Destroy presidential building then the Juggernaut 
VT that spawns in front of it.
* You've got time and supplies so take it slow. You can B-line it to the presidential 
building and secure it, destroy the building, then the boss than spawns with that 
event and ignore the rest of the map, OR you can take advantage of all those easy 
kills lying around and make some major command points. If you're up to a little fun 
first make your way towards the Stadium, ahead and to the left of your starting 
position. There are giraffes here and there, if you have to make a turn or move close 
take them out with a cannon or MG if in range, in not move by at high speed and ignore 
them. Once you reach the Stadium on the hill you will notice that the Stadium walls 
prevent you from targeting the enemy VTs inside, move around (taking out resistance 
as you do so) to the road leading in and the break in the stadium wall. Target the 
VTs in the open and take them out with rail gun and missiles. You may have to run 
in and get the last few VTs with a cannon or rain gun shot if they don't move in 
the open. After you're done here make a U-turn and head parallel to the presidential 
building land island/hill (the only other hill on the map besides the stadium). You 
will enter a large open area and there will be VT and giraffe aplenty in the distance 
use any ammo you have left then back off and call for supplies. Finish them off then 
time to attack the presidential island.
The front is guarded by 6 regals; 3 on each side. As you make your way to the back 
take out the 3 that are on your side (they won't show up on radar so watch the hill 
as you run). The best way is to bombard them with missiles from your low altitude 
position (this stops working once you get to the higher difficulty levels as the 
missiles will crash into the hill as they are moving so fast they don't have time 
to gain enough altitude). Once you reach the rear of the island take out any resistance 
and then make your way up the road to the hill. Once up there advance on the remaining 
3 regals and take them out. Give the building a few shots if you have them left over 
(be careful the building crumbles around 3000 damage), then re-supply if you are 
damaged or low on ammo and then finish the building off with the cannon. This will  

trigger a juggernaut VT to spawn in front of the presidential building so position 
yourself to get a good shot at him (standing anywhere against the front of the building 
will put you at his back), he has a rail gun and can take a few rail gun hits, so 
don't let your guard down.
Once you destroy the Juggernaut you will get an ending with a series of mediocre 
Photoshop's of VT's and stock war photos. Then it's back to business as usual, 
when you select your character you will be given the chance to start the first scenario 
set over again, or begin the second one. However once you start a scenario you will 
have to continue playing until either you beat the last level (10 or 23) or run out 
of supply points so think it over and make your choice.
**You don't have to Take out any other VTs than the final Juggernaut (and the 
presidential building to trigger his arrival). If you have the fire power and the 
confidence feel free to rush the presidential island, destroy the building, then the 
Juggernaut. You will clear the mission, just be careful if you left the regals around 
because the Juggernaut takes a while to explode, make sure you don't die waiting 
for him to. Also while that way saves a lot of time you are missing out on a lot of 
easy kills. So if you're trying to build up command points, don't waste the chance.

13) CAMPAIGN 2

* HAI SHI DAO 2080*
All right now you have command over your X-ray squad, and you're ready for some new 
missions and maps! Too bad, these are the same old missions with the same old maps 
(with the exception of 3 new maps), a few new enemies, but overall just a few small 
tweaks to the mission objectives. You will now have COM capabilities, assign commands 
for buttons 4 & 5 in the VT setup menu so you can give X-ray troop commands that they 
never listen to and instead walk in circles taking hits and missing a lot (unless 
you tell them to go home, in which case the respond to the order with extreme 
professionalism). One final thing, beating mission 23 is hard, you will need tons 
of supply points until you figure out what's going on. Reading this will make the 
missions A LOT easier (half the problem is knowing what is what you have to do and 
what is going to happen next) but you will die all the same. For smooth sailing, (and 
to avoid a repeat from zero) make sure you have enough supply points to buy supply 
chopper runs, and replacement VTs by playing the first scenario a few more times. 
You will also be able to unlock and operate 3rd generation VTs.

Mission 11 - Beach Assault (didn't we do this already?). Destroy 70%.
*Same drill, just you get to destroy a few extra m-vitzh along with the normal enemies.
Destroying the Giraffes and VTs will not be enough, so stomp on a few trucks to get 
to 70%

Mission 12 - Chopper madness. Protect your transports from the swarm of choppers 
assaulting them.
*(bring lots of machine gun for this mission!) Get out and start downing the choppers 
and occasional VT (you'll only encounter light class VTs). You have two teammates 
but their advanced AI will be so confused that they will just sit around drawing fire. 
Concentrate on the bigger choppers that fire homing missiles and the occasional VT. 
After you clean up the area (there are enemy VTs in front and behind the transport 
convoy) and down a bunch of choppers, the mission will end. I think the clear flag 
is a point limit as I down different numbers of VTs and choppers every time.

Mission 13 - ECM truck hunt. Destroy the three ECM trucks.
*Same drill as last time except the second you power up you will be attacked from 
the right. Your radar is being blocked by three ECM trucks. Run across the river and 
clear the area of VTs while moving, (your radar is blind so if you hold still you 
will be vulnerable to artillery attacks that you cant see coming) next search for 
the ECM truck on the top of the hill, it's big, square, and has a satellite dish 
on the top. After you destroy one you will hear from Argus and should be able to see 
flashes on your radar, next move to the hill after the bridge near the edge of the 
map, number 2 destroyed. Now move to where the Scarface was in the city in mission 
3, this time a Behemoth will be waiting for you, ECM number 3 is one intersection 
past where the enemy VTs are waiting for you. 

Mission 14 - Battleship & friends. Destroy the Battleship and the new destroyer 
patrolling the area.
*Same strategy as mission 4 but be careful of a few things, one: take out the missile 
boats as soon as you can. They will waste your chaff that you will need for the 
destroyer. Two: Ignore the battleship and get to the safe spot behind the building, 
the destroyer will patrol back and forth firing missiles at you, but no unguided 
projectiles so relax, pop a chaff and sink it with a few rail gun/cannon hits as 
there's nothing to lock on to for missiles. Then it's easy, just repeat the same 
process of hiding behind the building and taking shots when you have the chance to 
sink the battleship.

Mission 15 - VT Hunt. Destroy the fleeing VTs.
*same as mission 8 with a slight enemy hardware upgrade. But you've not going to 
let a little Scarface II get in your way right? Do the job quick, but do it with 
precision. Running out of ammo and waiting for supplies is both a waste of time and 
supply points. On higher difficulty levels missiles just take too long. But they are 
still good for tripping up a fleeing VT at long range where you could never make an 
accurate cannon shot.

*FORK IN THE ROAD*
Now you will be asked if you want to join combat group A or B. "A group" will move 
you to missions 16 & 17 and be familiar maps with easy content. "B group" will move 
you to missions 18 & 19 and be new maps with harder content. Make the choice and move 
out.

Mission 16 - Bomberman. Sneak in (read: blow everyone up before they can call for 
help.) without sounding the alarm, then place the bombs, detonate them and then run 
like a scared little girl.
*First this mission has a timer that starts when you spot an enemy VT. If you don't 
destroy it before the time is up then the alarm sounds and its game over man. But 
that should be no problem for a rail gun. Keep a good lookout with your camera as 
there are stealth VTs out patrolling too. There is a Jarc. VT around the corner of 
the canyon pass with a hyped-up cannon that fires like crazy. If you approach from 
the left passageway you will be going toe to toe which is dangerous. Knock him down 
with a rail gun shot or approach from the right passage to get a clearer shot. When 
you reach the base door contact Black Widow on COM 4, he'll mark where you have to 
place bombs. To place a bomb extend your manipulator arm after you are contacted by 
Black Widow and low and behold, it's got a bomb in its hand! (why can't I do that 
normally? Wouldn't it be great to knock a VT down, put a bomb on it, then back away 
and detonate it from afar?) Placing the bombs is just like opening doors, do all three 
on the flashing light beacons on the door's frame then get far away. See how the 
F3 button was flashing but stopped as you got too far away, it's the detonation button 
so get within range so it flashes but not so close that you take damage from the 
explosion. Also when you detonate be facing away from the door because you have to 
run like in level 6. (or if you're feeling lucky back away in reverse and pick them 
off as they come to you until you run out of ammo.)

Mission 17 - Enemy base, again. Repeat mission 7 with different enemies.
*You've destroyed the door so now you have to attack and secure the base before the 
enemy destroys any sensitive material. Read the walkthrough for mission 7, but expect 
a little more resistance. Two places to be careful of are: on the 3rd level of the 
base as you run down the hallway 4 Scylas instead of 2 will come out of the side 
hallways. 
Don't panic just keep using chaff as necessarily. Also when you open the final door 
the hyped-up Jaralaccs NS will be waiting for you with a Scyla on each side. Stay 
defensive as the Jar.-NS will take you out if you give him the chance.
**If you've got the extra gas and ammo (and haven't already unlocked the Quasar 
VT) check out the small room to your left as you enter the second floor of the base, 
in the back of the room you will find a VT-sized box with a switch. Inside is a Quasar 
VT. You'll receive a COM from Argus then the Quasar will be useable from the next 
mission. (Similar VT boxes are located in the other room as well as the 2 rooms on 
level 3 but they are all empty. (Note that the Quasar is in that room on your FIRST 
ATTEMPT, if you do not complete the mission the first time and try again, then the 
quasar is probably in another room, either on the same level or the one below.)

Mission 18 - Hogan's Alley. Move forward killing trucks, then run away when the enemy 
shows itself.
*This mission starts as an easy attack on a truck convoy. You can rack up some 
small-time points following the trucks or you can ignore the trucks and climb up the 
mesa as shown in the mission briefing. Either way once you get far enough you will 
encounter some Maelstroms positioned on the ridges. Argus will tell you to run away 
so run back and you will clear the mission once you reach the bottom of the mesa.
**This is also the mission to unlock the Maelstrom VT.

Mission 19 - Blade Drop. Destroy 70% of enemy forces.
*Hey! The only cinema in this scenario set! You can only use light VTs so get out 
that blade or rapier (that no one ever uses) and go. This is also the only scenario 
that doesn't make you power up the VT at the beginning. Clean up the two enemy VTs 
ahead of you and for once spend some major time cleaning up the little targets on 
the ground as well. This is so you can reach your 70% goal more quickly. Climb up 
a ramp and start working your way around killing VT and non VT targets. After a while 
Argus will alert you that enemy reinforcements have arrived, you'll know them when 
you see them. The buildings in the that the reinforcements show up in really get in 
your way, and you have a fragile VT with weak weapons, take it slow. There are a lot 
of enemy VTs out there, resist the temptation to rush forward because you will be 
chewing off more than you can chew. Stay back and try to pick them off one at a time, 
good luck.

Mission 20 - Deserters. Destroy the three Prominence M2 VTs.
*Not only did they run away but they took the best VTs with them. Watch out for a 
new missile attack that you haven't seen before (I want that gun, sigh), but it's 
all the same when you press the chaff button.

Mission 21 - VT battle. Destroy the three Juggernaut VTs.
*Same setup as mission 9 but you can destroy VTs all day and more will come to replace 
them (vortexes will not re-spawn but Scarfaces and Vitzhs will). Keep your VT moving 
quickly and search and destroy the three Juggernaut VTs.

Mission 22 - Hostage rescue. Rescue the 30 hostages from the presidential building.
*This mission you must rescue some hostages from the presidential building. You know 
this map and it's the same drill as mission 10. When you have cleared out the perimeter 
of the building contact Argus, which will trigger a chopper pickup automatically. 
There is no confirmation, so don't call Argus unless its safe, or the chopper will 
be flying to its doom (but Argus will send as many as it takes, just wastes time if 
they are shot down on their pickup run). The chopper will hover over the building 
for a few moments then fly away. If they are destroyed while making the pickup or 
on their way out then you will still have cleared one of the three chopper runs. The 
difference between making a safe chopper run is only whether you get the points or 
not. You have to do this successfully three times then you will clear the mission. 
Be on the lookout though, as you call for the pickup, Regals will spawn from the rear 
or sides of the land-island (near the ramp closest to the map border). The number 
that spawn are different every time but normally three will spawn when you make the 
first call and another will show up later from the same direction (some times more 
sometimes less, sometimes with different timing. Keep a lookout in the direction that 
the chopper approaches from and prevent them from attacking the chopper.

Mission 23 - The final showdown. Attack the enemy fortress and stop the enemy 
commander's escape.
*The ex-president is holed up in his fortress and the enemy forces are making their 
last stand here. The odds are not in your favor, about 30+ enemy VTs, with two that 
regenerate from the elevators, two choppers which will regenerate from off map if 
you destroy them, about 20+ giraffes and Scylas (some which are placed in the moat 
so that you cannot hit them until you are almost on top of them), to top things off 
add a sprinkle of MG and cannon defensive turrets. If you manage to get past all of 
that, and that is a big if, a boss waits that has fire power like you have never seen 
before. 
You, on the other hand get your VT and five brain dead teammates. Go team!
Here's how to do it: The 3rd generation VTs that you have access to have one gas tank. 
You can do it, but gas can be tight, (you can imagine how frustrating it will be when 
you finally kill the last boss then run out of gas and have to sit there) keep the 
override off when you don't need it and refuel before entering the elevator and on 
the second level and you should make it ok. If you feel lucky use a Regal N and bring 
a Pz-mis, HVM-la, and a cannon. If you want a ride with enough fuel to get you there 
and back, use the trustworthy, if a bit frail, Prominence M1, one fuel tank, main 
weapons missile and the weak cannon, sub weapon R-gun. The best choice is a Quasar 
or Juggernaut for a higher powered ride and a lot more armor and firepower (the 
Juggernaut makes even Desperado level difficulty easy). Load up on the cannon that 
does 1000 damage a shot! Also have about three or more supply runs available, less 
if you're good. To begin with there are your two teammates and a second VT group at 
the other corner of the map. Your teammates will trail behind you unless you tell 
them to go home or attack. Seeing as Tekki's AI is "Special", the other VT group 
will sit there and never move unless you happen to run close to where they are, (one 
triggered they will charge forward then get stuck trying to get around the big rock 
that is blocking their path, every time, highly advanced AI). Having such dependable 
teammates may temp you to bring them along but I find that they just get in the way 
most of the time. The only time I was ever glad to have them around was to distract 
the choppers which are just a nuisance really, (don't waste ammo on the choppers as 
they just come back). Instead lead the choppers towards your teammates and then let 
them play together for the rest of the mission. Next attack the lone VT group on this 
side of the right bridge. First take care of the enemy Scarface II then the two Vitzh. 
After they are destroyed prepare for your strafing run: The scene that awaits you 
is a moat with two bridges and tons of enemy VT's and turrets on the other side and 
mounted on the fortress. To make things even more interesting there are about 12 
giraffes in the moat, their turrets when extended can make shots at you but unless 
you are really close to the edge of the moat you will not be able to hit them. If 
you want to take them out what you have to do is just that, get really close. Start 
on either side, (the right side is easier to start from), and (while moving fast enough 
not to get hit, around overdrive 3rd for the Prominence M1) while hugging the edges 
of the moat, take the giraffes out one by one. The Enemy VTs will shoot at you but 
they're a good distance away and as long as you don't slow down you should be safe 
from cannon fire, avoid missiles with chaff. Next once you have secured the right 
bridge, use your missiles and R-gun to take out the VT group of one Behemoth and two 
Vitzh. A good way to take out the Behemoths (on easier difficulty levels) is to launch 
two missiles, after the second one knocks him down squeeze off a rail gun shot to 
finish the job while he is immobile on the ground. After that use your cannon or MG 
to clean up the turrets, then you can re-supply if you need it (keep track of fuel 
as well). There are two entrances to the fortress: ramps towards the rear of each 
side. Take out any turrets as they will distract you and make your way down either 
side. If you took the right side you should only have to deal with a regal dress or 
two if you're unlucky maybe a Behemoth. In a long range battle the Behemoths should 
be your priority as they will launch devastating long-range artillery bombardments 
(keep your radar close range here so you can detect and dodge the incoming fire) as 
they hide behind the walls, try to get line of sight and wipe them out. At closer 
ranges the Regals are more deadly so in that case shift your attention to them. The 
Regals will fire missiles and cannon so keep the chaff ready, dodge the cannon fire 
and take them out when you can't get a clear shot at a Behemoth. After you clean 
up the VTs on the walls take out any turrets you haven't yet and re-supply. As long 
as you stay far away from the ramp and keep alert for artillery you should be able 
to re-supply just outside of the fortress. When you're ready, charge the ramp. If 
you did it right you should only have to deal with one Regal, there may or may not 
be constant artillery bombardment from the Behemoth on the other side of the base. 
Knock down the Regal with a R-gun then finish with the cannon. After the job is done 
a new Regal should be coming out of the nearby elevator, it's sleepy from it's 
hibernation and wont do much dodging or attacking for a bit so quickly knock it down 
with a R-gun shot then repeat with cannon, or get close and do it all with the cannon. 
When the fresh Regal is done exploding rush into the elevator and then take a deep 
breath, you're halfway there. Push the button and move to the next floor. [From here 
on out the FAQ assumes that you entered the fortress from the right side.] There will 
be tons of targets here but don't panic, they can't touch you yet, proceed to the 
corner, and target the missile spider around the corner. Pop a chaff and calmly walk 
forward destroying it with one hit as its missiles fly everywhere, while your chaff 
is still working target the other spider at the end of the hall and kill it too if 
you can reach it (rarely it will have wandered off behind yet another hall blocking 
your LOF). There is a Scarface II in the next alley over but ignore him and move towards 
the ramp leading down. Use the corner trick and lots of dodging (overdrive time) to 
keep your body safe and take out the giraffes below with the cannon. When they are 
destroyed run down avoiding any fire from the Scarface II behind you. As you climb 
up the ramp there will be a giraffe waiting for you to the right, and a Scarface II 
close by. Take them both out then hang a left at the end and take out another Scarface 
II which may or may not be there(If not proceed to the door switch, no need to wait 
for him). Halfway down there is a door and switch on the right side. Open it and use 
the corner trick and cannon to destroy the spiders inside, or just use a chaff and 
walk in shooting the helpless spiders. Walk through and exit to the left, take another 
left and (no, the flaming pit is not good, do not fall in) you're in the elevator 
again. Head to the right and wait for the first Regal of three to poke out behind 
the corner finish him with missiles, or just rush them all if you have enough rail 
gun left. the other two will stay back, rush them with the rail gun shots you have 
left and when the job is done open the door. If you are in a regal you might want 
to take the left way, same enemies but you have a little more distance between you 
and them. Proceed and you will find yourself outside. You can safely call for supplies 
here. Go back in and head to the center of the map, you should see a door, there are 
enemies waiting behind that door so pop some chaff as you open it. And take out the 
near-by 3 missile spiders first, then concentrate on the 3 VTs in the back. Back out 
for more supplies, you'll need the ammo. Then proceed in and  destroy the generator 
in the corner that is glowing to open the next door if you already haven't. To the 
left to the passageway you will find the next elevator. Open the first door and enter, 
get ready because the second door is automatic, it will open when you get close. Once 
it opens and the shock sets in, get ready for the biggest enemy you will ever face.
BOSS : The Squared Eye
When the door opens concentrate your fire on the left and right targets, after you 
get a shot off dodge behind the doorway either side. Turn on the Overdrive and dodge 
out in the open let off a shot then get behind the wall again. There is just enough 
space to hide but be careful not to get too close to the front wall as that may lead 
to you bumping into the doorway leaving you out in the open, and about 2 seconds later 
dead. On the other hand don't get too far away because then the rocket barrage that 
the boss unleashes will be able to hit you. If leave the cover of the door room and 
enter the room the boss will ram you which means instant death. The left and right 
arms should only take one big gun and a few cannon hits each. If you dodged to the 
left then take out the right arm first, then the other arm. 3rd generation VTs have 
tons of chaff but if you don't have any left make your dodges out then back again 
to the same side instead of sliding across to the opposite side. This will be more 
dangerous for cannon fire but will increase your chances of dodging missiles (tracking 
you from the one side to the other may arc their flight path so they will avoid the 
corner and make it to you). After the Boss fully wakes up you will have to deal with:
Two Missiles: after the first 2 blow a succeeding set will be constantly launched, 
use chaff.
Two Cannons: these are the hardest to see and the easiest to fall prey to, they hurt 
so even if you don't see anything coming at you keep dodging.
One MG: there is a MG on the belly of the boss, it's always firing at you but you're 
at a safe distance by the doorway.
Two Rockets: Normally these rocket turrets will be firing at a normal rate, however 
every few seconds they will go crazy and launch about 15 rockets in about a second. 
The rocket spread is significant so either be on your way, or snug behind a wall when 
it happens. Check the radar to see if it's safe to come out or not.
EMG Pulse Attack: If your screen starts to go fuzzy and the boss looks like he's 
radio-active blue, then get behind a doorway! He's charging a pulse that will shut 
you down, if you're not behind cover when it happens, then it's all over.  
Target the center target last. After you have beaten the center target a good while 
it will eventually disappear leaving you with nothing to lock on to. Don't panic 
just keep up your pattern of dodging from one side to the other and make your shots 
to the body manually as you slide past. You will also have the chance to rush in the 
room and hide behind the pillars on either side of the room. This is a valid way to 
fight the boss, but the boss will move to face your position. If you loose control 
even for a second you will be dead before you realize what happened. Continue to pound 
the Boss and eventually he will start spraying smoke, fire, and what looks like rail 
gun blasts to the sides then will fall apart. 
When he's done blowing up an hour later proceed to the hallway behind him and run 
down it, (do not tear the joysticks off the controller if you run out of gas here) 
take the elevator up. When the elevator door is opening search for a small target 
indicator which marks the president's escape VTOL. You made it this far don't blow 
the kill, the jet will only hold still for a second before lifting off so don't waste 
any time.
Now you are treated to a different movie ending featuring the VTs in action. After 
that line up for your decoration and then it's back to business as usual.
**There is an alternative, faster way to get in the base at the beginning but there 
are a few problems. First charge the first VT grouping on this side of the bridge 
with your cannon or just ignore them. Once they are taken care of, rush the right 
bridge, use missiles and cannon to clear your path but don't slow down. (If you want 
your teammates to accompany you into the compound you should take out the giraffes). 
Then keep running until you make it to the ramp, don't waste time just climb up and 
when you reach the top you should see a behemoth and a few regals to your left, elevator 
to the right. Pick the Regal that looks like the one and destroy it quickly with a 
rail gun blast or the next best thing. Once the new regal comes out of the elevator 
ignore the remaining VTs and go for the fresh regal and then dash in the elevator.
This method is appealing because you can get there a lot faster and get out of the 
artillery danger zone quickly, if you're lucky (give them the "cover me" command) 
you may even have a teammate by your side drawing fire while fighting for the elevator. 
If so be very, very careful about friendly fire, I had a teammate plasma torch my 
Juggernaut from the rear and was dead before I knew what happened. Keep track of where 
they are, as teammates are just as deadly as enemies when you are in their LOF. The 
main problem with this method is there is no time to refuel, and the fighting by the 
elevator will be close range so you'll need a rail gun/powerful cannon, or some luck 
to line up some nice long range shots, two reasons that a 3rd generation VT regal 
dress N will have a hard time here.
**There is also an alternative way to destroy the boss (kinda' takes the fun out 
of things though). Turn on overdrive and trigger the doors to open. Take out the left 
and right arms as fast as you can with most powerful weapon you have at your disposal 
(I think that destroying the arms will stop the boss from ramming you, either way 
it will be hard to target them from behind). Once they are gone make a dash in the 
room and through the pillars to the rear of the boss. He will slowly turn to face 
you but do your best to keep to his rear. Once you are behind him he will no be able 
to attack you, at all. Keep moving as necessary to stay behind him, as he will continue 
to turn to try and face you. Now pound away until he begs for mercy, one word of caution 
though, don't attack the heavily armed body as it will do no damage, aim for the 
back of its head. To tell if you are doing damage watch the HUD and see if where you 
are shooting registers as a "HIT" or a "MISS", only the hits are doing damage. 
As long as you don't mess up the entry, this is the best and safest way to defeat 
the boss. (I feel so stupid for the 20+ times I've forced myself to fight him the 
normal way). But remember, mess-up the entry or leave his arms in tact and you might 
as well just push the ejection button now to save yourself some time.


14) DIFFICULITY LEVELS
Tekki has six difficulty levels to survive it's important to understand what has 
changed. One is the damage that the enemy VTs can take. On the higher levels even 
the little Vitzh can take around 3000 damage. What does not change is the VT physics, 
i.e. a 1000 damage round will knock over a Vitzh in rookie and in Armageddon modes, 
the difference is how many times they keep getting up. What this means is that you 
can no longer charge clusters of enemy VTs like you used to (for this and another 
reason explained later). Keep your distance and weed them out with long range fire.
The other thing that changes is projectile speed. Missiles, cannons, basically 
everything is going to be moving A LOT faster. In Armageddon it's almost comical 
how fast missiles move. The laughing stops when you realize the implications though:
1) now that missiles move a lot faster they don't have the time to change altitude 
like they used to. Normally missiles are a great weapon for hitting VTs in high places, 
now they are crashing to walls a lot. It still works but you will need a lot more 
room for your missile to gain altitude. 
2) Cannon fire is going to be coming in fast. Either you have the situation under 
control or you will be taking major damage. Again keep your distance.
3) Chaff is useless at close ranges. Pop some chaff on Armageddon and watch what 
happens when enemy units start firing missiles at you. The chaff is working but the 
missiles take a second before they weave off course, in that second most missiles 
will reach you due to their incredible velocity. This makes what were laughable 
enemies very deadly opponents, always have chaff out and do not get close to: missile 
spiders (scylas), scarface II, the destroyer in mission 14, buffalo choppers, etc. 
That's just the list of enemies that became a problem, don't even think of taking 
your eyes off of Regals or other VTs that were normally launching missiles at you. 
And don't even think of stopping the chaff flow on mission 20, an unchecked Prominence 
M2 cluster missile attack is your one way ticket to an early retirement.
Armageddon is an extreme, when I finished it and went back to normal the bullets seemed 
to be moving in slow motion. The point is to recognize what is changing and change 
your fighting patterns as necessary.

15) TIPS AND TRICKS

- Everyone's favorite Tekki salesman Andrew Cross has a new limited time offer for 
the more daring Tekki pilots: "The thank a tank program". Cutting right to the chase, 
this entails you picking up a tank or other object that will register a hit with 
VT-class weaponry and using it as a shield for incoming fire (offer void for splash 
damage weaponry). Simply pick the lucky volunteer up and then use it as a disposable 
shield, you'll loose the use of your sub weapon but you will be able to nullify one 
hit by lining it up right. We have yet to test this method on live troops and cows 
as the results are going to be messy.
- Conserving fuel: The 3rd generation VTs have one gas tank. This makes fuel 
conservation a big issue. If you need to make every drop count keep this in mind: 
overdrive movement sucks gas, but it's nothing compared to the fuel drain that occurs 
when you use the hydraulics. Hydraulics are drained when you use the dodge pedal or 
fire the rail gun. So for the longest ride, normal movement and no unnecessary jumps.
- Supply chopper trick: If you're fighting, and running out of ammo, and the supply 
chopper is approaching, let it start to refuel you. Your weapons will be disabled 
for the duration of the refuel but put the gearshift in 1-5 and make a dodge forward. 
The re-supply will halt and you will be able to fire a few shots. After you get the 
rail gun and missiles off then put it in reverse and make another jump back to where 
you were the chopper will once again start to refuel you and refill your ammo supply. 
This trick is good for battles where ammo runs out before gas. But be careful if you 
try this too close, the enemy will down your chopper and you'll have to call another 
if you're low on gas.
- Corner trick: your guns are not centered on your VT, the main cannon is on the right. 
Edge up to a corner so your right side is partially sticking out. You will be able 
to hit targets while keeping your body safe behind the wall.
- Do not underestimate the power of the giraffe. Yes they look stupid, hardly move, 
and have a slow rate of fire, but give them a few shots at close range and you will 
be dead quickly.   
- The Designers didn't include a pause function, which makes for a more involved 
battle. 
However there are real-life problems when someone knocks on the door or the fire in 
the kitchen is getting closer to you, etc. Simply unplug the controller and the game 
will pause, plug it back in when the fires are out and viola.
- Enemy Chaff will continue to tweak your missiles for a few seconds after deployment. 
When a missile weaves off path wait a while before firing the next. Chaff is also 
area specific. If VT 1 is to the right and has deployed chaff, and VT 2 is in a position 
slightly separated from VT 1 then your missiles will be able to track VT 2 even though 
VT 1 has deployed chaff
- You can lock and fire guided missiles at close range, But they will hit, explode, 
and do absolutely no damage. Lesson to be learned: check the effective ranges of your 
weapons and use them within those ranges.
- Guided missiles are Fire & Forget, if you have multiple targets fire then lock on 
to the next enemy VT. Missiles will also knock down small VT's with one hit, destroy 
them with two. For missions that dictate ammo conservation, knock VT's down with one 
missile then close and finish the job with a more conventional weapon that has more 
ammo.
- The R-gun can knock almost all VTs down with one hit, use the above strategy. 
- Missiles will try to match altitude almost immediately after they are launched, 
this makes them able to hit high targets that may be obscured by the edge of a cliff, 
and also makes them crash into the same edge of the cliff if you are in the high 
position. 
Experiment in free mode and learn how your weapons operate.
- You can pick up cows with the manipulator arm. You can also pick up tanks, trucks, 
and foot soldiers. Let them squirm then squeeze them to finish the job. I wish you 
could also punch VTs, oh well.
- Load up a free mission and take a low-stress view of how the FSS works in relation 
to enemy VT movement, the knowledge you gain here will be invaluable for future 
rail-gun shots: When enemy VTs dodge to the side the FSS will move your aim to the 
left, this will hit if you fire the second the VT starts the dodge but will miss most 
of the time as the aiming cursor will not revert back to a centered position until 
well after the VT has stopped it's dodge. The trick is to wait for the cursor to move 
back on the enemy VT, not prematurely fire when the VT stops moving in its dodge as 
there is a brief pause between the two. The other way is to turn off the FSS and make 
the enemy dodge, when the target VT slides to a halt but does not have its balance 
yet make your shot. It will be unable to avoid in time if you have a fast enough weapon.
- In the Replay mode you can change views with lock on, and add screen filters with 
the trigger. Purely for fun.


16) CODES & HIDDEN FEATURES


- [CONFIRMED] This code will unlock all levels and VT's in free mission mode:
At the title screen position your COM tuner dial to the printed number 0 (9 o'clock 
if you were looking at a clock), from here you will need to move your com dial to 
the below positions and leave it there for one second on each position. (remember 
that the first marking: 9 o'clock is 0, and that the last marking: 6 o'clock is 
12 for the code)
Start at 0, then move to 1, to 9, to 7, to 9, to 0, to 9, to 0, to 6.
Finish imputing the code before the title screen fades away to the replay. After you 
input the code you should hear a sound. Now you can use any VT on any mission in the 
free mission mode. This of course does not affect the normal campaign game. Once you 
input the code Tekki will save the change so you only need to do it once.

- [CONFIRMED] After you complete mission 23 on Normal difficulty you will unlock a 
movie viewer in the config menu. (only viewable in the main menu config menu, the 
in game config menu will not give you the option.)
- [CONFIRMED] After logging 55 game hours, press Ignition and Start buttons to remove 
all the gauges and dials for a non-distorted full screen view.
- [CONFIRMED] After beating the game in Desperado mode you will unlock the Autobot 
code. In game press the Hatch and Start buttons and your VT will lower its body (and 
your view) down to ground level. Your speed will not be affected by the transformation 
and you will never fall down in this mode.
- [CONFIRMED] Get 800000 command points (Colonel Rank) and you can use the Juggernaut 
VT.
- [CONFIRMED] Beat mission 23 on Veteran level difficulty and you will unlock the 
next difficulty level "Desperado" as well as a voice select option in the main config 
menu. There are three voices in all (two new ones, plus the original.) The option 
is only visible when in Japanese voice mode. You will also unlock a code to switch 
back and forth from color and B&W screens. Press start and night scope during the 
loading screen and when the mission is done loading you will have a B&W screen if 
you are in a VT with a color screen, and vice versa.
- [CONFIRMED] Beat mission 23 on Magnum Force level difficulty and you will unlock 
the ability to jump. In mission press start and F3 then continually jump to gain 
altitude. (helps to have the brake pedal down if you want to get big air.)
- [CONFIRMED] Log 100 hours of game time and reset the X-box. Beat the 2082 mode once 
then after that you can press start and reload during the loading screen to activate 
the unlimited fuel and ammo code.
- [CONFIRMED] On one of the towers in mission 20 there is a man waving his arms at 
you (lieutenant Silver Star). If you can grab him with your manipulator-arm and then 
complete the mission you will unlock the Spotlight. Once you save Silver Star you 
will always have the spotlight which is toggled on and off with F2. This code can 
be unlocked in free mission mode.
- [CONFIRMED] On mission 6 on a difficulty level greater than Normal you can save 
Corporal Arnold in a similar manner to destroy all weight limits on equipping your 
VT with guns. Arnold is located inside the hanger door that opens when you get too 
close to the base, you have to fight your way in and then look inside for him (left 
of the second door), grab him, and then make it out alive. After the code is unlocked 
start a new campaign or free mission then at the briefing menu press start and main 
weapon (on the center block) to remove all weight limits and allow your VT to equip 
any weapon. If you did it correctly you should see a"WEP ALL" message appear on 
the briefing screen. This code can be unlocked in free mission mode.

18) Industrious & Insane


-BASICS-

This section is for those hard core gamers who want to go all the way and construct 
a cockpit for their Tekki experience. For those who wish to begin the planning and 
construction of their Tekki box but have yet to get a controller of their own, the 
dimensions of the controller and pedals will be recorded here. I also hope to post 
here the exploits of those brave souls and pass the wisdom of their triumphs and 
mistakes those bold (and insane) enough to follow in their path.
Describing the measurements in pure text form may be a little difficult to understand. 
As such I have created a set of blueprints that will make the below description easier 
to comprehend. For a copy of the blue prints send a mail to me (mike_box@hotmail.com) 
with the title of the mail "FAQ I&I". If you can't be bothered to do that then 
I can't be bothered to send you the file.
The controller is made up of 4 parts. The left, right, center, and pedal blocks.
The three hand controlled blocks are connected by a ribbon cable (like a hard drive 
cable) and then secured into place by two bolt plates and 8 screws. In theory you 
could extend the cables and re-arrange the controller so that the left and right blocks 
were are your sides like a real cockpit, not bolted to the center block.
Each block is fitted with rubber base legs that prevent it from sliding. The pedal 
block's wire exits from the rear of the block and plugs into the rear of the center 
block. The center block has another wire that exits the rear and plugs into the X-Box 
controller port.

-MEASUREMENTS-

*Left Block Measurements*
(The measurement points are (from a top view) located clockwise starting at the top 
left corner: A-B-H-G, where H would be the bottom right corner, ask me for the 
blueprints if you have any questions.)
A-B & G-H = 26cm
A-G & B-H = 19.5cm
P = 24cm (From the base of the block to the top of the joystick)
The Left block gearshift does not hang over the side of the controller so no extra 
room is needed on the outside edge. However the joystick when fully pressed to the 
right extends over the right edge of the block about 3cm. This is not a factor if 
you have the blocks bolted together.

*Right Block Measurements*
(Top left corner = E clockwise F, L, K)
E-F & K-L = 26cm
E-K & F-L = 19.5cm
P = 24cm (From the base of the block to the top of the joystick)
The right joystick is capable of movement in all directions, while it does not poke 
over the outside edge of the block (F-L), it does on both the inside (E-K) (about 
1.5cm) and the top (E-F) (about 8 cm). Again the extension to the inside edge is not 
a factor is you have the blocks bolted together.

*Center Block Measurements*
(Top left corner = C clockwise D, J, I)
C-D = 35.5cm
I-J = cm
C-I & D-J = cm

*Assembled Control Block Measurements*
A-F = 88.5cm
G-L = 79cm
R-S = 26cm

*Pedal Block Measurements*
The pedal block contains a base and three pedals. The base is a square except for 
the upper left corner which tapers away leaving no distinctive corner to base 
measurements from. As such starting from the lower left corner (M) and skipping to 
the upper right (N) and ending in lower right (O)
M-O = 35.5cm
N-O = 30cm
Q = 19cm (from the base of the block to the highest point on the pedals)
Out of the three pedals the gas pedal sticks out the most from the upper edge (5cm). 
The Dodge pedal is curved making it stick out both forward and to the left. If the 
block was a perfect 30 x 35.5 square then it would stick out 2cm to the left.

-ADVICE-
Here I will post things that I think would be important in planning the design of 
your cockpit. I also hope to include the advice and stories of those who actually 
do it. Send me some mail guys.
-Don't place your center block to low, or your monitor too high in your cockpit.
The LEDs on the controller will flash giving you valuable warnings. If you have to 
take your eyes away from the action to check which warning is going off on your 
controller you will be wasting time. 
-Place the pedal block close to the base of your feet so that you can floor the pedals 
with ease. Tekki's pedal sensors are not too accurate (most likely a software 
shortcoming rather than the hardware) so the difference of flooring it 100% and 
leaving a bit off is significant. Also pressing the pedals forward instead of down 
will contribute to wear and loosen them so that they wobble a bit left to right.
-No stories or advice from cockpit constructors yet...


X. VERSION HISTORY
v.1.14 - 1/18/03 - haven't touched tekki for quite some time now but I had a few 
mistakes in the cheats section, this may be the last update, I'll wait a little more 
then upload a final.
v.1.13 - 12/08/02 - Just a few additions to the codes.
v.1.12 - 12/02/02 - Sorry I've been slow to update, don't play Tekki much anymore, 
70 hours is a long time. Got a new code for you, as well as a few small updates.
v.1.11 - 11/01/02 - Measurements for section 18 are complete, almost. Some of my 
measurements conflicted with the Capcom Jap site info but I was fairly careful and 
I don't think they were giving measurements for the widest parts of the base. I'm 
going to double-check over the weekend.
v.1.11 - 10/31/02 -Isn't it Halloween in the US around now? I lost track of the seasons 
over here. Fixed a few typos and created section 18 due to demand. You guys are insane.
v.1.10 - 10/30/02 - Beating Armageddon offered the same thing as Magnum, nothing. 
I've got tons o' command points and decorations so I think that there is nothing 
left to update that way. I guess I'll but in the remaining hours to try and reach 
100 hours but that's a pain in the butt. Anyway lots of tweaks to the FAQ, Update 
time.
v.1.09 - 10/29/02 - When will the madness end? Armageddon difficulty had better be 
the last. This is getting repetitive, no, actually it was repetitive around Veteran 
Difficulty. Sigh.
v.1.08 - 10/28/02 - Access to the net restored, update time.
v.1.07 - 10/27/02 - All these new difficulty settings are beginning to wear. The 
transformation code is nifty and all but how many times do I have to play the same 
missions over and over again?
v.1.06 - 10/25/02 - New Update. Some more polish to the walkthrough (The last boss 
is a joke now.) and completion of the Desperado mode. I thought that would be it and 
I could move on but now I have to deal with Magnum Force, wasn't that a NES game?
v.1.05 - 10/24/02 - I finished mission 23 on Veteran last night and I got another 
message asking me to beat Desperado mode. Besides the new difficulty level there is 
a voice select option under the movie viewer in the config menu. Nothing special.
v.1.04 - 10/22/02 - New Update. Filled out the VT list, The Juggernaut created a new 
slot so maybe there is still hope for the Prominence M2. But on the other hand it 
wont be the first VT that appeared in the game but was never made useable (Ah how 
I wanted to use the Jaralaccs NS, VT on crack). The Rapier was a big letdown, why 
unlock it so late in the game? Some more Weapons added, and some minor changes to 
the walkthrough. 
v.1.02 - 10/21/02 - Time for an Update. A lot of polish and corrections have been 
made. Also managed to beat mission 23 on normal last night.
v.1.00 - 10/19/02 - I changed my mind about the menu explanations, with a little 
experimentation anyone can figure them out. It would just add unneeded bulk to this 
already overweight FAQ. Also got a mail with tons of good info that I didn't include 
in the FAQ should be ready to update on Monday. The Quasar is also finally here.
v.0.90 - 10/18/02 - The FAQ is posted, and I'm starting to iron out some of the minor 
errors as well as patch up the holes. I've beaten the first scenario on all difficulty 
levels and am about to finish the second scenario on normal. But still no new VTs. 
I hope you don't have to beat level 23 on veteran to get the last two.
v.0.80 - 10/16/02 - Ready or not here it comes, besides the gamefaq guy was complaining 
that things were too slow. Tons of info, finished the VT, Main WP and Sub listings 
which took forever. Still need to fill in a few spots in other areas but getting close 
to completion. Anyone know how to get the Prominence M2 or the Juggernaut?
v.0.70 - 10/16/02 - The Boss went down and I am a happy gamer. I also tried entering 
the fortress from the right side and it was about 10 times easier. Still no new VTs 
though. I hope you don't have to beat the second scenario on veteran because even 
the first scenario gets a little tricky on veteran. I don't even want to think about 
level 22 on veteran!
v.0.60 - 10/15/02 - I spent the weekend building up a new character, I also got the 
regal dress N and A but they both have only one gas tank, and weak short range abilities 
(well not true but not having a rail gun makes for an even harder level) making them 
unsuitable for the last mission. I went up against the boss a few times again (I have 
that level memorized now) and I get annihilated every time. I need to pass this level. 
Someone mentioned that a strategy guide was going on sale in the US pretty soon, better 
post this FAQ before then, complete or otherwise.
v.0.50 - 10/11/02 - I used my last two tries last night, the first one I got messed 
up pretty badly, the second I made it to the boss tried the corner trick and took 
out the center target! It took around 30 shots from my cannon, but as I went to finish 
off the remaining arm I got killed. My character is still alive but there is no way 
to beat that mission with weak VTs and no supplies, so he is good as dead. I started 
a new game and was surprised at how quickly I could work through missions 1-10.
Somebody posted some new codes for full screen and crouch. Have to try that later 
when I get home.
v.0.40 - 10/10/02 - Damn the last boss is tough, I have enough points left for two 
more tries but I hope I don't have to do it all again with a new character. Started 
the Tips & Tricks section. 
v.0.30 - 10/09/02 - Finished controls and have a better idea of what I have to do 
in the other sections. I hope I can beat level 24 before I run out of supply points... 
I should have replayed the easy scenario one more time to get more points before moving 
on to mission 11. Oh well too late now.
v.0.20 - 10/08/02 - The Tekki board is mostly a bloated mess of people who love to 
talk but have nothing to say. The two reviews posted at this time are wack, and most 
of the posters are people who haven't played the game or are stuck on levels 1-6. 
Time for a FAQ.


Z. CREDITS


This FAQ is mostly my work, however from time to time a board poster or friendly gamer 
was nice enough to pass on some info. A few of the crazy people to actually play this 
game more than me, or posted useful information include:
- Galan Pang for passing on the address and some great info from a Japanese board! 
(Quasar VT location, Juggernaut pilot requirements, rank info, and code rumors.) 
Everyone give Mr. Pang a hand for filling out some of the empty VT slots! 
- Sonsaru (for relaying the crouch and full screen info, although They turned out 
to be activated a different way.)
- Thanks to the Japanese Tekki site for posting the free mission code.
- Andrew Cross for the tank shield trick.
- http://members.tripod.co.jp/waita/tekkiura.html for some info on codes.
Thanks for the posts and help.

Legal Info: If you want to post this FAQ on your site, ask me, I'll most likely say 
yes. This Guide is for people who want to use it. If this FAQ helps someone create 
a better FAQ for Tekki then great, feel free to use this material. Just give credit 
where it's due.
